<p>man (Gal. 5:24); the world, the cosmos, the evil system of Satan (John 12:31); the old</p>

<p>a. Christ is not only the Creator of the one new man, the church,  but also the</p>
<p>sphere in which and the element and essence with which the new man was</p>
<p>created.</p>
<p>65 b. Christ is the very element and essence of the one new man, making God’s divine</p>

  <span class="outline-text">B. In the creating of the new man, first our natural man was crucified by Christ,and then</span>
</div>
<p>through the crossing out of the old man, Christ imparted the divine element into us, causing</p>
<p>us to become the masterpiece of God’s work, an absolutely new item in the universe,  a new</p>

  <span class="outline-text">So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away;</span>

<div class="clear"></div>
<p>behold, they have become new.</p>

  <span class="outline-text">1. The Greek word for masterpiece is poiema, meaning “something that has been written</span>

<p>righteousness and sanctification and redemption,</p>
<p>a. He is our righteousness ( for our past), by which we have been justified by God,</p>
<p>that we might be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life —Rom. 5:18; 8:10.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 5:18</span>
  <span class="outline-text">So then as it was through one offense unto condemnation to all men, so</span>

<p>also it was through one righteous act u nto justification of life to all men.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 8:10</span>
  <span class="outline-text">But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>is life because of righteousness.</p>
<p>b. He is our sanctification (for our present), by which we are being sanctified in our</p>
<p>soul (transf ormed in our mind, emotion, and will) with His divine life —6:19, 22.</p>

<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 6:22</span>
  <span class="outline-text">But now, having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you have your</span>

<p>fruit unto sanctification, and the end, eternal life.</p>
<p>c. He is our redemption (for our future), that is, the redemption of our body, by</p>
<p>which we will be transfigured in our body with His divine life to have His</p>
<p>glorious likeness — 8:23; Phil. 3:21.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 8:23</span>
  <span class="outline-text">And not only so, but we ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the</span>

  <span class="outline-text">B. Often we are conscious of three parties within us: a positive party, a negative party, and a</span>

<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">1. Whenever we sense that different parties within our being are arguing or quarreling,</span>
</div>
<p>we need to give place to the presiding peace of Christ and allow this peace, which is</p>
<p>the oneness o f the new man, to rule within us and have the final word.</p>

<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">1. Through the arbitration of the peace of Christ, our problems are solved, and the</span>

<p>friction between the saints disappears; then the church life is preserved in sweetne ss,</p>
<p>and the new man is maintained in a practical way.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">2. The arbitrating of the peace of Christ is Christ working within us to exercise His rule</span>

<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Isa 9:6</span>
