  <span class="outline-text">3. After His incarnation, through resurrection He was begotten by God in His humanity</span>

  <span class="outline-text">C. Paul was able to see the Lord’s resurrection in Psalm 2:7: “You are My Son; ⁄ Today I have</span>

<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">1. Paul applied the word today to the day of the Lord’s resurrection.</span>
</div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">2. This means that Christ’s resurrection was His birth as the firstborn Son of God.</span>
</div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">3. Jesus, the Son of Man, was born to be the Son of God through being raised up from</span>
</div>
<p>the dead; therefore, God’s raising up Jesus from the dead was His begetting of Him to</p>
<p>be His firstborn Son —Acts 13:33.</p>

<p>2 D. Through incarnation God’s only begotten Son put on humanity and became the God -man</p>
<p>(John 1:14, 18; Luke 1:35); then i n resurrection this God -man was born of God to be His</p>
<p>Firstborn (Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:6; Rom. 8:29):</p>
<div class="outline-point">

<p>image of His Son, that He might be t he Firstborn among many brothers;</p>

  <span class="outline-text">1. Before incarnation God’s only begotten Son did not have the human nature; He had</span>
</div>
<p>only the divine nature.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">2. In resurrection God’s firstborn Son has the human nature as well as the divine nature.</span>
</div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">E. Through His resurrect ion Christ was born to be the firstbornSon, and at the same time all</span>
</div>
<p>His believers were born to be the many sons of God —1 Pet. 1:3; Heb. 2:10:</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">1 Pet 1:3</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great</span>

<div class="clear"></div>
<p>leading many sons into glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect thr ough</p>
<p>sufferings.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">1. Among these many sons, only the Firstborn is God’s only begotten Son —John 1:18; 1</span>
</div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">John 4:9</span>

  <span class="verse-ref">1 John 4:9</span>
  <span class="outline-text">In this the love o f God was manifested among us, that God sent His only</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>begotten Son into the world that we might have life and live through Him.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">2. This only begotten Son of God, in His resurrected humanity, is also the firstborn Son</span>
</div>
<p>of God —Rom. 8:29.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 8:29</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Because thos e whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers;</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">3. The Firstborn has both divinity and humanity, and we, His believers as God’s many</span>
</div>
<p>sons, also possess both the human na ture and the divine nature —2 Pet. 1:4.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">2 Pet 1:4</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Through which He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature, having</p>
<p>escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">II. We need to know Christ in His resurrection designated as the  Son of God in</span>
</div>
<p>power with His human nature —Rom. 1:3 -4:</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 1:3</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh,</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 1:4</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">A. Before His incarnation and resurrection, Christ was the Son of God, the only begotten</span>
</div>
<p>Son—John 1:18; 3:16.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">John 1:18</span>
  <span class="outline-text">No one has ever seen God; the only begot ten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father,</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>He has declared Him.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">John 3:16</span>
  <span class="outline-text">For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.</p>
<p>3 B. Although Christ already was the Son of God before the incarnation, He still needed to be</p>
<p>designated the Son of God out of resurrection because by incarnation He had put on the</p>
<p>human nature, which had nothing to do with divinity —1:1, 14; Rom. 8:3:</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">John 1:1</span>
  <span class="outline-text">In the beginning was the Word, a nd the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">John 1:14</span>
  <span class="outline-text">And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory,</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 8:3</span>
  <span class="outline-text">For that which the law could not do, i n that it was weak through the flesh, God,</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin,</p>
<p>condemned sin in the flesh,</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">1. After the Son of God became incarnate, His divine nature was concealed by the flesh.</span>
</div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">2. Christ was already  the Son of God in His divinity, but the part of Him that was Jesus</span>
</div>
<p>with the human nature, born of Mary, was not the Son of God —Luke 1:31 -32, 35.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Luke 1:31</span>
  <span class="outline-text">And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>His name Jesus.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Luke 1</span>
  <span class="outline-text">:32 He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>give to Him the throne of David His father,</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Luke 1:35</span>
  <span class="outline-text">And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you,</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>and the power of the Most High will oversh adow you; therefore also the holy</p>
<p>thing which is born will be called the Son of God.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">3. By His resurrection Christ sanctified and uplifted His human nature, His humanity,</span>
</div>
<p>and He was designated out of resurrection as the Son of God with this human nature;</p>
<p>in this sense He was begotten the Son of God in His resurrection —Rom. 1:3 -4; Acts</p>
<p>13:33; Heb. 1:5.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 1:3</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh,</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 1:4</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spi rit of</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Acts 13:33</span>
  <span class="outline-text">That God has fully fulfilled this promise to us their children in raising up Jesus, as it</span>

<p>is also written in the second Psalm, "You are My Son; today I have begotten You ."</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Heb 1:5</span>
  <span class="outline-text">For to which of the angels has He ever said, "You are My Son; this day have I</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>begotten You"? And again, "I will be a Father to Him, and He will be a Son to Me"?</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">4. This designation of the Son of God was “in power,” the power of Christ’s</span>
</div>
<p>resurrec tion, the reality of which is the Spirit — Rom. 1:4; Phil. 3:10; Eph. 1:19 -20.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 1:4</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Phil 3:10</span>
  <span class="outline-text">To know Him and the p ower of His resurrection and the fellowship of His</span>

<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Eph 1:20</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Which He caused  to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>Him at His right hand in the heavenlies,</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">C. Through designation in resurrection the Christ who was already the Son of God before His</span>
</div>
<p>incarnation became the Son of God in a new way —Rom. 1:4:</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom  1:4</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">1. Before His incarnation He was the Son of God only with divinity; through His</span>
</div>
<p>resurrection He was designated the Son of God with both divinity and humanity —v. 4.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 1:4</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Who was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">2. If Christ had not put on human nature, there would ha ve been no need for Him to be</span>
</div>
<p>designated the Son of God, for in His divinity He was already the Son of God, even</p>
<p>from eternity — John 1:18; 17:5.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">John 1:18</span>
  <span class="outline-text">No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the</span>

  <span class="outline-text">And now, glorify Me along with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>You before the world was.</p>
<p>4 3. Having put on humanity through incarnation, He was designated the Son of God with</p>
<p>humanity in resurrection —1:14; Rom. 8:3; 1:3 -4; He b. 2:14:</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">John 1:14</span>
  <span class="outline-text">And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His</span>

<p>glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 8:3</span>
  <span class="outline-text">For that which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, G od,</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin,</p>
<p>condemned sin in the flesh,</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 1:3</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Concerning His Son, who came out of the seed of David according to the flesh,</span>

  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 1:4</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Who was designated the Son of God in power according t o the Spirit of</span>

<p>holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Heb 2:14</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>like manner partook of the same, that through death He might destroy him who</p>
<p>has t he might of death, that is, the devil,</p>
<p>a. As the designated Son of God, Christ has two natures, divinity and humanity;</p>
<p>the humanity that He now has is not a natural humanity but a humanity uplifted</p>
<p>in resurrection —Rom. 1:4.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 1:4</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Who was designated the S on of God in power according to the Spirit of</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>holiness out of the resurrection of the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord;</p>
<p>b. Even Christ’s human nature has been designated the Son of God, for He has</p>
<p>been designated the Son of God with both divinity and humanity.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">D. The designation of Christ as the Son of God with humanity was “according to the Spirit of</span>
</div>
<p>holiness” —v. 4:</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">1. The Spirit of holiness is the life essence within the Lord Jesus; when He lived on earth</span>
</div>
<p>in the flesh, He had this essence within Him —Matt. 1:18 , 20; Luke 1:35.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Matt 1:18</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Now the origin of Jesus Christ was in this way: His mother, Mary, after she had</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>been engaged to Joseph, before they came together, was found to be with</p>
<p>child of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Matt 1:20</span>
  <span class="outline-text">But while he pondered these things, behol d, an angel of the Lord appeared to</span>
