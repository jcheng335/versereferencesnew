  <span class="outline-text">I. Second Corinthians 4:4 -7 shows us that we  may experience  and enjoy Christ</span>

</div>
<p>12:31; 14:30; 16:11; Eph. 2:2),has blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers:</p>

<p>the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God,</p>

<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">2. All people today, whether primitive or highly cultu red, have been blinded by the god</span>
</div>
<p>of this age.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">3. We need to pray, “Lord, Itrust in You to defeat the god of this age; apart from You,</span>
</div>
<p>Ido not worship anyone or anything.”</p>

  <span class="outline-text">4. If we pray in this way, the divine light will shine, and we will receive revelation.</span>
</div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">5. If we drop our concepts and turn our heart to the Lord (3:16), the veils will betaken</span>

  <span class="verse-ref">Col 1:15</span>

<div class="clear"></div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">E. The expression the image of the invisible God implies that although God Himself is</span>

<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Col 1:15</span>

<div class="clear"></div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">F. The invisible God has a visible image, and this image is Christ:</span>
</div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">1. John 1:18 says, “No one has ever seen God; the only begotten  Son, who is in the</span>
</div>
<p>bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.”</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">2. Although God is invisible, He is expressed by a living person, that is, Jesus Christ, the</span>
</div>
<p>Son of God —3:16.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">John 3:16</span>
  <span class="outline-text">For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone</span>

<div class="clear"></div>
<p>who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">III. “We have this treasure in earthen vessels” —2 Cor. 4:7a:</span>
</div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">A. Christ as the life -giving Spirit in us is the One who shines and works; this is the treasure we</span>
</div>
<p>have in us.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">B. God’s shining  in our hearts (vv. 4, 6) brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is</span>
</div>
<p>the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">2 Cor 4:4</span>
  <span class="outline-text">In whom the god of this age has blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers that the</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, might not</p>
<p>shine on them.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">2 Cor 4:6</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Because the God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus</p>
<p>Christ .</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">C. Because of the shining in our hearts, we have a treasure that is wonderful, precious, and</span>
</div>
<p>marvelous.</p>
<p>33 D. This treasure, the indwelling Christ, in us, the earthen vessels, is the divine source of the</p>
<p>supply for the Christian life —v. 7.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">2 Cor 4:7</span>
  <span class="outline-text">But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>of God and not out of us.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">E. The expression this treasure in 2 Corinthians 4:7 refers to verse 6, where Paul speaks of the</span>
</div>
<p>face of Jesus Christ:</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">2 Cor 4:7</span>
  <span class="outline-text">But we have this  treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be</span>

<p>of God and not out of us.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">2 Cor 4:6</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Because the God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of the glory of God in the  face of Jesus</p>
<p>Christ.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">1. The shining of God in our hearts is to illuminate us that we may know the glory of</span>
</div>
<p>God in Christ’s face.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">2. The glory of God manifested in the face of Jesus Christ is the God of glory expressed</span>
</div>
<p>through Jesus Christ; to know Him is  to know the God of glory —v. 6.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">2 Cor 4:6</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Because the God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>shined in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of the glory of God in the face</p>
<p>of Jesus Christ.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">3. Literally, the Greek word for face in 2 Corinthians 4:6 is the same word translated</span>
</div>
<p>“person” in 2:10, which refers to the part around the eyes, the look as the indexof the</p>
<p>inward thoughts and  feelings,  which  shows  forth  and manifests  the whole  person.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">2 Cor 4:6</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Because the God who said, Out o f darkness light shall shine, is the One who</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>shined in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of the glory of God in the face</p>
<p>of Jesus Christ.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">2 Cor 2:10</span>
  <span class="outline-text">But whom you forgive anything, I also forgive; for also what I have forgiven, if I</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>have forgiven anyth ing, it is for your sake in the person of Christ;</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">4. This indicates that unless we have the indexof Christ’s face, He cannot be a treasure</span>
</div>
<p>to us in reality:</p>
<p>a. We will not sense that we have a treasure within us until we see the face of Jesus</p>
<p>Christ.</p>
<p>b. On the one hand, we can all declare that we are the earthen vessels and that</p>
<p>Christ is the treasure within us.</p>
<p>c. On the other hand, we need to see that it is only when we are living in the</p>
<p>presence of Christ, looking at the indexof His being, that we will sense that He</p>
<p>is a treasure to us — v. 10.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">2 Cor 2:10</span>
  <span class="outline-text">But whom you forgive anything, I also forgive; for also what I have</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it is for your sake in the person of</p>
<p>Christ;</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">F. The first step of God’s procedure in fulfilling His purpose was to create man as an earthen</span>
</div>
<p>vessel to contain Himself as life — Gen. 2:7:</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Gen 2:7</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>the breath of life, and man became a living soul.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">1. God chose us so that we  may be vessels of honor filled with the Triune God —Rom.</span>
</div>
<p>9:21, 23; 2 Cor. 13:14.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 9:21</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Or does not the potter have authority over the clay to make out of the same</span>

  <span class="outline-text">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>the Holy Spirit be with you all.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">2. The New Testament shows us that God wants believers as vessels loving Him and</span>
</div>
<p>keeping themselves open to Him — Rom. 9:21, 23; 2 Cor. 3:16.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 9:21</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Or does not the potter have authority over the clay to make out of the same</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>lump one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor?</p>
<p>34 Rom 9:23  In ord er that He might make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of</p>
<p>mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory,</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">2 Cor 3:16</span>
  <span class="outline-text">But whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">3. If in the depths of our being we are not open to the Lord,  He cannot dispense Himself</span>
</div>
<p>into us and make His home in our heart —1 Cor. 2:10.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">1 Cor 2:10</span>
  <span class="outline-text">But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit, for the Spirit searches all</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>things, even the depths of God.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">4. An open vessel is doing nothing but keeping itself  open to be filled by the divine</span>

<div class="clear"></div>
<p>unto all the fullness of God.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">G. We are weak because we are earthen vessels; however, a treasure within us, the vessel,</span>
</div>
<p>enables us to keep ourselves open to the  Lord, giving Him every opportunity to do</p>
<p>everything He wants to do; this is the proper and genuine Christian life —v. 17; Gal. 2:20.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Eph 3:17</span>
  <span class="outline-text">That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted</span>

<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">IV. “That the excellency of the  power may be of God and not out  of us” —2 Cor.</span>
</div>
<p>4:7b:</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">A. The fact that we are earthen vessels proves that the excellency of the power is of God and</span>
</div>
<p>not out of us:</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">1. In ourselves we are nothing more than earthen vessels; we are sinful, fallen, and low.</span>
</div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">2. As such, we do not have the power to manifest the truth and shine forth the glory of</span>

<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">B. Although we are worthless earthen vessels, God has shined the precious treasure into us:</span>
</div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">1. Now this treasure becomes the source of the power energizing us and enabling us to</span>
