<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">A. This indicates that the Christ who is the power of God and the wisdom of God for the</span>

<p>carrying out of God’s economy is the crucified Christ, a Christ who did not do anything to</p>

<p>accomplishing what is planned and purposed.</p>

  <span class="outline-text">3. When we experience the crucified Christ, He becomes to us not only the power of</span>

<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 6:6</span>

  <span class="outline-text">4. The crucified Christ as God’s wisdom is related to God’s deep and profound plan</span>

  <span class="verse-ref">Eph. 1:9,</span>

<p>which He purposed in Himself,</p>

  <span class="outline-text">In whom also we were designated as an inheritance, having been predestinated</span>

<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Eph 3:11</span>
  <span class="outline-text">According to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord,</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>a. Since we have the crucified Christ as God’s wisdom, there  is no need for us  to</p>
<p>seek a way to carry out God’s will.</p>
<p>b. Simply by experiencing the crucified Christ, we spontaneously have a way to do</p>
<p>God’s will.</p>
<p>c. We become very wise in doing the will of God —Col. 1:9; 4:12.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Col 1:9</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Therefore we also, since the day we heard of it, d o not cease praying</span>

</div>

<p>fully assured in all the will of God.</p>
<p>d. As long as we experience the crucified Christ, Christ will become to us God’s</p>
<p>wisdom to fulfill His plan; we will have the wisdom of God to do His will —1:9.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Col 1:9</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Therefore we also, since the day we heard of it, do not cease praying</span>

  <span class="verse-ref">Gal 2:20</span>
  <span class="outline-text">I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me;</span>

<p>loved me and gave Himself up for me.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">1. All that we are, all that we have, and all that we can do —all is completely terminated.</span>
</div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">2. When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, as we are experiencing and enjoying</span>
</div>
<p>Him, His crucifixion will terminate us.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">3. Christ crucified is not only the power but als o the way for us to be delivered from the</span>
</div>
<p>flesh, the natural life, and the old creation.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">II. As those who are called by God, we need to know and experience Christ‟s</span>
</div>
<p>power and wisdom —1 Cor. 1:24:</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">1 Cor 1:24</span>
  <span class="outline-text">But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks , Christ the power of God and the</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>wisdom of God.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">A. First Corinthians 1:2 mentions “the called saints”:</span>
</div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">1. The believers in Christ are called saints, not called to be saints; this is a positional</span>
</div>
<p>matter, a sanctification in position with a view to sanctifi cation indisposition.</p>
<p>19 2. To call upon the name of the Lord implies to believe into Him —Rom. 10:14.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 10:14</span>
  <span class="outline-text">How then shall they call upon Him into whom they have not believed? And how</span>

<p>shall they believe into Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they</p>
<p>hear without one who proclaims Him?</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">3. All the believers in the Lord should be callers —Acts 9:14, 21; 22:16.</span>

  <span class="verse-ref">Acts 9:21</span>
  <span class="outline-text">And all who heard him were amazed and said, Is this not the one who ravaged</span>

<div class="clear"></div>
<p>those who call upon this name in Jerusalem and came here for this, that he</p>
<p>might bring them bound before the chief priests?</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Acts 22:16</span>
  <span class="outline-text">And now, why do you delay? Rise up and be baptized and wash away your</span>

<div class="clear"></div>
<p>sins, cal ling on His name.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">4. We have been called to call, called by God to call upon the name of the Lord.</span>
</div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">5. To those called by God, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</span>
</div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">B. Those who are called (1 Cor. 1:24) refers to the believers who were chosen by  God in</span>

<p>eternity (Eph. 1:4) and who believed in Christ in time (Acts 13:48).</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">1 Cor 1:24</span>
  <span class="outline-text">But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the</span>

  <span class="outline-text">Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without</span>

<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Acts 13:48</span>
  <span class="outline-text">And the Gentiles, hearing this, rejoiced and glorified the word of the Lord; and as</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>many as were appointed to eternal life believed.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">C. To those who believe in Christ and call upon His name, He is the power of God and the</span>
</div>
<p>wisdom of God.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">D. Christ crucified is the power of God for saving us and the wisdom of God for fulfilling His</span>
</div>
<p>plan:</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">1. Power is the ability, and wisdom is the way.</span>
</div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">2. Christ is first our power, and then He is our wisdom, that is , our way.</span>
</div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">3. Christ is the power of God to carry out God’s economy, and He is also the wisdom of</span>
</div>
<p>God, the way of God, to carry out God’s economy.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">E. Christ as the power of God strengthens us with a dynamic power, supplying and sustaining</span>
</div>
<p>us in what we are  and what we do:</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">1. In all our circumstances and conditions, Christ as the power of God enables us to</span>
</div>
<p>suffer, to bear burdens, and to stand firm.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">2. He also sustains us to the point of being unshakable; for this reason, Paul declares, “I</span>
</div>
<p>am able to do all things in Him who empowers me” —Phil. 4:13.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">3. Christ as the power of God is daily supplying and sustaining us through His divine</span>
</div>
<p>dispensing.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">F. Christ as the wisdom of God flows unceasingly from God to us to be our present and</span>
</div>
<p>practical wisdom in our experience —1 Cor. 1:24.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">1 Cor 1:24</span>
  <span class="outline-text">But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>wisdom of God.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">III. “Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us  from God: both</span>
</div>
<p>righteousness and sanctification and redemption” —v. 30:</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">A. In this verse Paul does not say that Christ became our wisdom; instead, he says that Christ</span>
</div>
<p>became wisdom “to us from God”:</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">1. The expression to us from God indicates something present, practical, experiential,</span>
</div>
<p>and ongoing in the way of transmission.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">2. For Christ to become wisdom to us from God indicates that there is the transmission</span>
</div>
<p>of Christ as wisdom from God to us for our daily experience.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">3. We need Christ continually as wisdom to us from God.</span>
</div>
<p>20 B. Christ became wisdom to us from God as three vital things in God’s salvation:</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">1. He is our righteousness (for our past), by which we have been justified by God, that</span>
</div>
<p>we might be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life —Rom. 5:18.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 5:18</span>
  <span class="outline-text">So then as it was through one offense unto condemnation to all men, so also it</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>was through one righteous act unto justification of life to all men.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">2. He is our sanctification (for our present), by which we are being sanctified in our soul,</span>
</div>
<p>that is, transfor med in our mind, emotion, and will, with His divine life —6:19, 22.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 6:19</span>
  <span class="outline-text">I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>presented your members as slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness unto</p>
<p>lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness unto</p>
<p>sanctification.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 6:22</span>
  <span class="outline-text">But now, having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you have your fruit</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>unto sanctification, and the end, eternal life.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">3. He is our redemption (for our future), that is, the redemption of our body (8:23), by</span>
</div>
<p>which we will be transfigured in our body with His divine life to have His glorious</p>
<p>likeness (Phil. 3:21).</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 8:23</span>
  <span class="outline-text">And not only so, but we ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit,</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>even we ourselves groan in ourselves,  eagerly awaiting sonship, the</p>
<p>redemption of our body.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Phil 3:21</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Who will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all</p>
<p>things to Himself.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">4. It is of Go d that we participate in such a complete and perfect salvation, which makes</span>
</div>
<p>our entire being —spirit, soul, and body —organically one with Christ and makes</p>
<p>Christ everything to us.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">5. This is altogether of God, not of ourselves, that we may boast and glory i n Him, not in</span>
</div>
<p>ourselves —Eph. 3:20 -21.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Eph 3:20</span>
  <span class="outline-text">But to Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think,</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>according to the power which operates in us,</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Eph 3:21</span>
  <span class="outline-text">To Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all the generations</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>forever and ever. Amen.</p>
