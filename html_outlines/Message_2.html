  <span class="outline-text">E. While we remain in the touch with the Lord, staying in contact  with the Lord, the law of the</span>
</div>
<p>Spirit of life works aut omatically, spontaneously, and effortlessly:</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="outline-text">1. We need to cease from our own struggling and striving —Gal. 2:20a; Rom. 7:15 -20:</span>
</div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Gal 2:20</span>
  <span class="outline-text">a  I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives</span>

  <span class="outline-text">For what I work out, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice;</span>

<div class="clear"></div>
<p>but what I hate, this I do.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 7:16</span>
  <span class="outline-text">But if what I do not will, this I do, I agree with the law that it is good.</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 7:17</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Now then it is no longer I that work it out, but sin that dwells in me.</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 7:18</span>
  <span class="outline-text">For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>present with me, but to work out the good is not.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 7:19</span>

  <span class="outline-text">But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that work it out but sin that</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>dwells in me.</p>
<p>8 a. If we have not seen that sin is a law and that our will can never overcome this</p>
<p>law, we are trapped in Romans 7; we will never arrive at Roman s 8.</p>

<p>b. Paul willed again and again, but the result was only repeated failure; the best</p>
<p>that a man can do is to make resolutions —7:18.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 7:18</span>
  <span class="outline-text">For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>is present with me, but to work out the good is not.</p>
<p>c. When sin is dormant within us, it is merely sin, but when it is aroused in us by</p>
<p>our willing to do the good, it becomes “the evil” —“I find then the law, with me</p>
<p>who wills to do the good,because the evil is prese nt with me” —v. 21.</p>
<p>d. Instead of willing, we should set our mind on the spirit and walk according to</p>
<p>the spirit —8:6, 4; Phil. 2:13.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 8:6</span>

  <span class="outline-text">F. The whole  key to our living and serving in the Body of Christ is the law of the Spirit of life,</span>

<p>which operates within us:</p>

<p>10 Matt 14:23  And after He sent the crowds away, He went up to the mountain</p>

<p>note 2  To meet with God in the morning is not only to meet with Him early</p>
<p>in the day; it is also to meet with God in a situation that is full of</p>
<p>light (cf. Prov. 4:18). Like Moses, we should go to God alone,</p>
<p>without any persons, matters, or things to distract or oc cupy us (v.</p>
