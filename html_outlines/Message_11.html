<p>a. The fruit of the light must be good in nature, righteous in procedure, and real in</p>
<p>expression, that  God may be expressed as the reality of our daily walk.</p>
<p>b. The fruit of the light in goodness, righteousness, and truth is related to the</p>
<p>Triune God:</p>
<p>1) God the Father as goodness is the nature of the fruit of the light; therefore,</p>
<p>goodness in verse 9 refe rs to God the Father —Matt. 19:17.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Eph 5:9</span>

</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>There is only One  who is good. But if you want to enter into life,</p>
<p>keep the commandments.</p>
<p>2) Righteousness refers to God the Son, for Christ came to accomplish God’s</p>
<p>purpose according to God’s righteous procedure —Rom. 5:17 -18, 21.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 5:17</span>

<p>gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 5:18</span>
  <span class="outline-text">So then as it was through one offense unto condemnation to all</span>

<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">Rom 5:21</span>

</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>through righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our</p>
<p>Lord.</p>
<p>3) Truth, the expression of the fruit of the light, refers to God the Spirit, for</p>
<p>He is the Spirit of reality —John 14:17; 16:13.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">John 14:17</span>
  <span class="outline-text">Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because</span>

<p>He abides with you and sh all be in you.</p>
<div class="outline-point">
  <span class="verse-ref">John 16:13</span>
  <span class="outline-text">But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all</span>
</div>
<div class="clear"></div>
<p>the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but what He hears</p>
<p>He will speak; and He will declare to you the things that are</p>
<p>coming.</p>
<p>c. The proof that we ar e walking as children of light is seen in the bearing of such</p>
<p>fruit.</p>
