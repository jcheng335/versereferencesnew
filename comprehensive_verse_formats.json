In Romans 1:3-4 Christ, the Son of God, is the prototype, whereas in 8:29 the\nmany brothers are those who have been “mass-produced” from the prototype\nand, by being saved in life, will be conformed to the image of the firstborn\nSon.\n3.

In the dispensations from Adam to Moses and from Moses to Christ, everything\nwas unveiled, manifested, and there was no mystery.\nC. It will be the same in the dispensation of the millennial kingdom and the new\nheaven and new earth-everything will be unveiled, and then there will be no\nmore mystery.\nD. Christ Himself (Col. 2:2), the church (Eph. 3:4-6), the kingdom of the heavens\n(Matt. 13:11), the gospel (Eph. 6:19), the indwelling of Christ (Col. 1:26-27), and\nthe coming resurrection and transfiguration of the saints as the end of this\ndispensation of mystery (1 Cor. 15:51-52) are all mysteries that were hidden in\ntimes of the ages (Rom. 16:25; Eph. 3:5; Col. 1:26).\nE. All these mysteries will be completed, finished, and will be over at the trum-\npeting of the seventh trumpet.\nF. At the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet, not only God’s judgment of wrath\nupon the earth but also the mystery of God are finished.\nG. In the dispensation from the incarnation of Christ to the millennial kingdom-\nthe church age, the age of grace-everything is a mystery:\n1. The incarnation of Christ, as the beginning of the age of mystery, is a mys-\ntery-1 Tim. 3:16.\n2. Christ is the mystery of God-Col. 2:2.\n3. The church is the mystery of Christ-Eph. 3:4-6:\na. Christ is a mystery, and the church, as the Body of Christ to express\nHim, is the mystery of Christ.\nb. Christ and the church as one spirit are the great mystery-5:32; 1 Cor.\n6:17.\nc. During the church age, the age of mystery, Christ is building up the\nchurch to be His bride-Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:16; Rev. 19:7-9.\n4. The kingdom of the heavens, the indwelling of Christ, and the resurrection\nand transfiguration of the saints are all mysteries-Matt. 13:11; Col. 1:26-27;\n1 Cor. 15:51-53.\nIV. The mystery of the church is the ultimate mystery in the universe:\nA. The church is the hidden mystery in God’s eternal economy-Eph. 3:9-11:\n1. The mystery of the universe is God, the mystery of God is Christ, and the\nmystery of Christ is the church-Gen. 1:1; Rev. 4:11; Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4.\n2. According to Ephesians 3:4, the church has a particular title-the mystery\nof Christ.\n3. In the ages before the New Testament, the mystery of the church was hidden\nfrom men",
      "Col. 1:26.\n4. The mystery of the church was hidden from eternity past throughout the\nOld Testament times, but in the New Testament age it has been manifested\nto all the believers in Christ.\n5. In the New Jerusalem God obtains an eternal and full expression in the\nman whom He created",
      "Eph. 5:32.\n6. Our spirit needs to be strong and full of wisdom and revelation so that we\nmay know the mystery of the church-1:17.\n7. The mystery of Christ and the mystery of the church are great and deep.\nB. The great mystery-Christ and the church-is the meaning of the universe\nand of human life-Rev. 4:11; Eph. 5:32:\n1. God’s intention in His creation of all things, including man, was that man\nwould be mingled with God to produce the church-Zech. 12:1; Eph. 3:9.\n2. The desire of God’s heart is to have the mystery of Christ-the Body of\nChrist as the increase and expression of Christ-1:5, 9, 11, 22-23.\n3. The Body life is the ultimate satisfaction of our spiritual experience-5:30.\n4. The economy of the mystery hidden in God throughout the ages is the mys-\ntery of the church as the Body of Christ-3:9-10.\n5. The mystery of Christ and the mystery of the church should be our daily\nlife",

We need to pay careful attention to two phrases in verse 15: in His flesh and in Himself:\n1. “In His flesh” Christ terminated all the negative things in the universe: Satan, the\ndevil, the enemy of God (Heb. 2:14)",

      "Eph. 2:15).\n2. “In Himself” as the sphere, element, and essence, Christ created the Jews and the\nGentiles into one new man:\na. Christ is not only the Creator of the one new man, the church, but also the sphere\nin which and the element and essence with which the new man was created.\nb. Christ is the very element and essence of the one new man, making God’s divine\nnature one entity with humanity-cf. Col. 3:10-11.\nB. In the creating of the new man, first our natural man was crucified by Christ, and then\nthrough the crossing out of the old man, Christ imparted the divine element into us,\ncausing us to become the masterpiece of God’s work, an absolutely new item in the uni-\nverse, a new invention of God-Rom. 6:6; 2 Cor. 5:17:\n1. The Greek word for masterpiece is poiema, meaning “something that has been writ-\nten or composed as a poem.”\n2. Not only a poetic writing may be considered a poem, but also any work of art that\nexpresses the maker’s wisdom and design.\n3. We, the church, the masterpiece of God’s work, are a poem expressing God’s infinite\nwisdom and divine design",
      "Eph. 3:10-11.\n4. Christ became wisdom to us from God as three vital things in God’s salvation-\n1 Cor. 1:30:\na. He is our righteousness (for our past), by which we have been justified by God,\nthat we might be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life-Rom. 5:18",

It is of God that we participate in such a complete and perfect salvation, which makes\nour entire being-spirit, soul, and body-organically one with Christ to make Him\neverything to us and to make us the wise exhibition of all that Christ is.\nIII. On the cross Christ created the new man in Himself by abolishing in His flesh\nthe law of the commandments in ordinances, the middle wall of partition-Eph.\n2:14b-15a:\nA. The law spoken of in verse 15 is not the law of the moral commandments but the law of\nthe ritual commandments, such as the ordinances of circumcision, keeping the Sabbath,\nand eating certain foods.\nB. Ordinances are the forms or ways of living and worship, which create enmity and divi-\nsion:\n1. On the cross Christ abolished all the regulations regarding living and worship,\nregulations that have divided the nations-v. 15; Col. 2:14.\n2. From the time of Babel, mankind has been divided by ordinances concerning the ways\nof living and worship",

In the past there were too many mouths because there were too many persons.\nb. With one accord and with one mouth (Rom. 15:6) mean that even though we are\nmany and all are speaking, we all “speak the same thing” (1 Cor. 1:10).\nc.

In our daily walk we should always care for our Father’s feeling, for we live\nintimately in His tender love.\n2. The goal of the book of Ephesians is to bring us into love as the inner sub-\nstance of God that we may enjoy His presence in the sweetness of the divine\nlove and thereby love others as Christ did-5:25:\na.
