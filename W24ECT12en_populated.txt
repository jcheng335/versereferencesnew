Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:7-16; 6:10-20
     Eph. 4:7-16: 7. But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ. 8. Therefore the Scripture says, “Having ascended to the height , He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.” 9. (Now this, “He ascended ,” what is it except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth? 10. He who descended, He is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things.) 11. And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers , 12. For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry , unto the building up of the Body of Christ, 13. Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ , 14. That we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error, 15. But holding to truth in love , we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head , Christ, 16. Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love .

I. Ephesians 4:7-16 presents to us Christ as the Giver of gifts for the intrinsic building up of the organic Body of Christ; this building up is by the giving, the dispensing, of the divine grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ:
    Ephesians 4:7-16: 7. But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ. 8. Therefore the Scripture says, “Having ascended to the height , He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.” 9. (Now this, “He ascended ,” what is it except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth? 10. He who descended, He is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things.) 11. And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers , 12. For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry , unto the building up of the Body of Christ, 13. Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ , 14. That we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error, 15. But holding to truth in love , we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head , Christ, 16. Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love .

    A. Every member of the Body of Christ is an indispensable gift to the Body—v. 7; 1 Cor. 12:14-22; Rom. 12:4-5:
        1 Cor. 12:14-22: 14. For the body is not one member but many . 15. If the foot should say, Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body, it is not that because of this it is not of the body. 16. And if the ear should say, Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body, it is not that because of this it is not of the body. 17. If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were the hearing, where would the smelling be? 18. But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed . 19. And if all were one member, where would the body be? 20. But now the members are many, but the body one . 21. And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you. 22. But much rather the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.
         Rom. 12:4-5: 4. For just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function , 5. So we who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another.

        1. The gift of Christ is a person constituted with Christ’s life and element dispensed into him by the Divine Trinity—cf. 2 Cor. 1:15.
            2 Cor. 1:15: 15. And in this confidence I intended to come to you previously that you might have double grace ,

        2. Each gifted person has a measure, and the divine grace is given, dispensed, into him according to that measure—Eph. 4:16; cf. Rom. 12:3.
            Eph. 4:16: 16. Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love .
             Rom. 12:3: 3. For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think, but to think so as to be sober-minded , as God has apportioned to each a measure of faith.

    B. The intrinsic building up of the organic Body of Christ is by the giving of the gifted persons, such as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, who are constituted by the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, by Christ as the Head in His ascen- sion (including His resurrection), to the Body of Christ—Eph. 4:8-12:
        Eph. 4:8-12: 8. Therefore the Scripture says, “Having ascended to the height , He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.” 9. (Now this, “He ascended ,” what is it except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth? 10. He who descended, He is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things.) 11. And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers , 12. For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry , unto the building up of the Body of Christ,

        1. Ephesians 4:8 says, “Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken cap- tive and gave gifts to men”: bolizing the third heaven, where God dwells (1 Kings 8:30). the Ark had won the victory (Num. 10:35); this portrays how Christ has won the victory and ascended triumphantly to the heavens. who had been taken captive by Satan and made them gifts to His Body—Eph. 4:8-11: (1) The redeemed saints had been taken captive by Satan before they were saved by Christ’s death and resurrection—cf. Luke 4:18. (2) In His ascension Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan’s captivity and took them to Himself—Psa. 68:18. (3) In His ascension Christ led them to the heavens as His captives in His train of vanquished foes and made them gifts to His Body. (4) Now Christ is celebrating His triumph over them, His vanquished foes, and is leading them as His captives in a triumphal procession in His move for His ministry to build up His Body—2 Cor. 2:14.
            Ephesians 4:8: 8. Therefore the Scripture says, “Having ascended to the height , He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.”
            1 Kings 8:30: 30. And listen to the supplication of Your servant and of Your people Israel when they pray toward this place. Hear then in Your dwelling place in the heavens ; and when You hear, forgive.
            Num. 10:35: 35. And when the Ark set out, Moses said, Rise up, O Jehovah, and let Your enemies be scattered; And let those who hate You flee before You.
            Eph. 4:8-11: 8. Therefore the Scripture says, “Having ascended to the height , He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.” 9. (Now this, “He ascended ,” what is it except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth? 10. He who descended, He is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things.) 11. And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers ,
             Luke 4:18: 18. “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to announce the gospel to the poor ; He has sent Me to proclaim release to the captives , and recovery of sight to the blind , to send away in release those who are oppressed ,
            Psa. 68:18: 18. You have ascended on high; You have led captive those taken captive; You have received gifts among men, Even the rebellious ones also, That Jehovah God may dwell among them.
            2 Cor. 2:14: 14. But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ and manifests the savor of the knowledge of Him through us in every place.

            a. Height in the quotation from Psalm 68:18 refers to Mount Zion (vv. 15-16), sym-
                 Psalm 68:18: 18. You have ascended on high; You have led captive those taken captive; You have received gifts among men, Even the rebellious ones also, That Jehovah God may dwell among them.

            b. Psalm 68 implies that it was in the Ark that God ascended to Mount Zion after
            c. Through His universal traffic and in His ascension, Christ led as captives those
        2. The more Christ ascends and descends within us, capturing and vanquishing us, the more He fills us with Himself to constitute us as gifts to His Body—cf. Eph. 4:9-10.
             Eph. 4:9-10: 9. (Now this, “He ascended ,” what is it except that He also descended into the lower parts of the earth? 10. He who descended, He is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens that He might fill all things.)

    C. The intrinsic building up of the organic Body of Christ is by the gifted persons’ perfect- ing of the saints in the divine dispensing so that all the saints may be able to do the work of the New Testament ministry, that is, to build up the Body of Christ—vv. 11-12:
        1. The gifted persons perfect the saints by nourishing them according to the tree of life with the life supply for their growth in life—Gen. 2:9; 1 Cor. 3:2, 6.
            Gen. 2:9: 9. And out of the ground Jehovah God caused to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, as well as the tree of life in the middle of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
            1 Cor. 3:2: 2. I gave you milk to drink, not solid food , for you were not yet able to receive it . But neither yet now are you able,

        2. The gifted persons perfect the saints to do what they do for the direct building of the Body of Christ—Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:11-12; cf. 1 Tim. 1:16; 4:12.
            Matt. 16:18: 18. And I also say to you that you are Peter , and upon this rock I will build My church , and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.
             Eph. 4:11-12: 11. And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers , 12. For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry , unto the building up of the Body of Christ,
            1 Tim. 1:16: 16. But because of this I was shown mercy , that in me, the foremost, Jesus Christ might display all His long-suffering for a pattern to those who are to believe on Him unto eternal life.

        3. The result of this perfecting is that we will all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ—Eph. 4:13; cf. John 17:23. 4. This perfecting will cause us to be no longer little children tossed by waves and
carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a
view to the satanic system of error—Eph. 4:14.
5. This perfecting will cause every member of the Body of Christ to be a building mem-
ber in love—growing up into the Head and functioning out from the Head—vv. 15-16.
II. Ephesians 6:10-20 reveals that Christ is the constituents of God’s armor:
A. The whole armor of God is for the entire Body of Christ as the corporate warrior, not for
any individual member of the Body; we must fight the spiritual warfare in the Body, not
as individuals—vv. 10-13; James 4:7; cf. Rom. 13:12-14; Deut. 32:30.
B. In Ephesians 2 we sit with Christ in the heavenlies to participate in all His accom-
plishments (v. 6); in chapters 4 and 5 we walk in His Body on the earth to fulfill God’s
eternal purpose (4:1, 17; 5:2, 8, 15); then in chapter 6 we stand in His power in the
heavenlies to fight against God’s enemy (vv. 11, 13-14; cf. 1 John 5:4, 18; John 3:6b).
C. “Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth”—Eph. 6:14a:
1. Truth here refers to God in Christ as the reality in our living, that is, God realized
and experienced by us in our living; this is actually Christ Himself lived out by us—
4:15, 21, 24-25; John 14:6; 8:31-32, 36.
2. The truth with which we are girded is actually the Christ whom we experience;
because Paul’s living was conformed to the pattern of Christ, he had the strength to
face all opposition and adverse circumstances—Eph. 4:20-21; Phil. 1:19-21a.
D. “Having put on the breastplate of righteousness”—Eph. 6:14b; 1 Cor. 1:30; Jer. 23:6:
1. Christ as the breastplate of righteousness covers our conscience, signified by the
breast; in fighting against Satan, our accuser, we need a blood-purified conscience, a
conscience void of offense—Heb. 9:14; 10:22; Acts 24:16.
2. “They overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb” (Rev. 12:11); our response to
Satan’s accusations should be, “I overcome Satan, the accuser, not by my perfection
and not even by a conscience void of offense but by the blood of the Lamb; I am
defended against his accusations by the breastplate of righteousness.”
E. “Having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace”—Eph. 6:15:
1. Christ has made peace for us on the cross, both with God and with man, and this
peace has become our gospel; the gospel of peace has been established as a firm
foundation, as a readiness with which our feet may be shod—2:13-17.
2. We fight the spiritual warfare by standing in peace; if we lose the peace between us
and God or between us and other believers, we lose the standing to fight—Col. 3:15.
F. “Besides all these, having taken up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to
quench all the flaming darts of the evil one”—Eph. 6:16; 2 Cor. 4:13; Heb. 12:2:
1. The flaming darts are Satan’s temptations, proposals, doubts, questions, lies, and
attacks; we need to take up the shield of faith to quench these flaming darts.
2. We need to exercise our spirit of faith with our subdued and resurrected will to
believe that the Lord’s manifestation is to destroy the works of the devil—1 John 3:8;
Matt. 16:22-23; Luke 4:39-41; Matt. 12:28; Luke 10:17, 19.
3. We need to exercise our spirit of faith to believe that the Lord’s death has destroyed
Satan—Heb. 2:14; Gen. 2:17; 3:15; Gal. 2:20; Rom. 6:3-6; 1 Cor. 15:54-58.
4. We need to exercise our spirit of faith to believe that the Lord’s resurrection has put
Satan to shame—Col. 2:12-15, 20; 3:1; John 14:30; Phil. 3:10; Isa. 61:10; Zech. 3:4-5.
5. We need to exercise our spirit of faith to believe that the ascension of the Lord is far
above Satan’s power—Eph. 1:19-23; 2:6; 6:11, 13.
            Eph. 4:13: 13. Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ ,
             John 17:23: 23. I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one , that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me.
            Eph. 4:14: 14. That we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error,
             Ephesians 6:10-20: 10. Finally , be empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength. 11. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil , 12. For our wrestling is not against blood and flesh but against the rulers , against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness , against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies . 13. Therefore take up the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand . 14. Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth and having put on the breastplate of righteousness 15. And having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace ; 16. Besides all these, having taken up the shield of faith , with which you will be able to quench all the flaming darts of the evil one. 17. And receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, 18. By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints, 19. And for me, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known in boldness the mystery of the gospel, 20. For which I am an ambassador in a chain , that in it I would speak boldly , as I ought to speak.
             James 4:7: 7. Be subject therefore to God; but withstand the devil , and he will flee from you.
             Rom. 13:12-14: 12. The night is far advanced, and the day has drawn near. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the weapons of light. 13. Let us walk becomingly as in the day ; not in reveling and drunkenness , not in fornication and licentiousness, not in strife and jealousy . 14. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill its lusts.
             Deut. 32:30: 30. How shall one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Were it not that their Rock sold them, And Jehovah delivered them up?
            1 John 5:4: 4. For everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world ; and this is the victory which has overcome the world—our faith .
             John 3:6: 6. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .
            Eph. 6:14: 14. Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth and having put on the breastplate of righteousness
             John 14:6: 6. Jesus said to him, I am the way and the reality and the life ; no one comes to the Father except through Me.
            Eph. 4:20-21: 20. But you did not so learn Christ, 21. If indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus,
             Phil. 1:19-21: 19. For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 20. According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame , but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death . 21. For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain .
            1 Cor. 1:30: 30. But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption ,
             Jer. 23:6: 6. In His days Judah will be saved, And Israel will dwell securely; And this is His name by which He will be called, Jehovah our righteousness.
            Heb. 9:14: 14. How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
             Acts 24:16: 16. Because of this I also exercise myself to always have a conscience without offense toward God and men.
            Rev. 12:11: 11. And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death.
            Eph. 6:15: 15. And having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace ;
            Col. 3:15: 15. And let the peace of Christ arbitrate in your hearts, to which also you were called in one Body; and be thankful .
            Eph. 6:16: 16. Besides all these, having taken up the shield of faith , with which you will be able to quench all the flaming darts of the evil one.
            2 Cor. 4:13: 13. And having the same spirit of faith according to that which is written, “I believed, therefore I spoke,” we also believe, therefore we also speak,
             Heb. 12:2: 2. Looking away unto Jesus , the Author and Perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross , despising the shame , and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God.
            1 John 3:8: 8. He who practices sin is of the devil , because the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested , that He might destroy the works of the devil.
            
Matt. 16:22-23: 22. And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You! 23. But He turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan ! You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.
             Luke 4:39-41: 39. And standing over her, He rebuked the fever, and it left her. And she instantly rose up and served them. 40. And when the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and He laid His hands on each one of them and healed them. 41. And demons also came out from many, crying out and saying, You are the Son of God! And He rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that He was the Christ .
             Matt. 12:28: 28. But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
             Luke 10:17: 17. And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name.
            Heb. 2:14: 14. Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death , that is, the devil ,
             Gen. 2:17: 17. But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die .
             Gal. 2:20: 20. I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith , the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.
             Rom. 6:3-6: 3. Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? 4. We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life . 5. For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection, 6. Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled , that we should no longer serve sin as slaves;
            1 Cor. 15:54-58: 54. And when this corruptible will put on incorruption and this mortal will put on immortality, then the word which is written will come to pass, “Death has been swallowed up unto victory .” 55. Where , O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting ? 56. The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law . 57. But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 58. Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast , immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
            Col. 2:12-15: 12. Buried together with Him in baptism, in which also you were raised together with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who raised Him from the dead. 13. And you, though dead in your offenses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our offenses; 14. Wiping out the handwriting in ordinances , which was against us, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross. 15. Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it .
             John 14:30: 30. I will no longer speak much with you, for the ruler of the world is coming, and in Me he has nothing;
             Phil. 3:10: 10. To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,
             Isa. 61:10: 10. I will rejoice greatly in Jehovah, My soul will exult in my God; For He has clothed me with the garments of salvation, He has wrapped me with the robe of righteousness; I am like a bridegroom who wears the headdress of the priest, And like a bride who adorns herself with her jewels.
             Zech. 3:4-5: 4. And He answered and spoke to those standing before Him, saying, Remove the filthy garments from him. Then He said to him, See, I hereby make your iniquity pass from you and clothe you with stately robes. 5. And He said, Let them put a clean turban upon his head. And they put the clean turban upon his head and clothed him with garments while the Angel of Jehovah stood by.
            Eph. 1:19-23: 19. And what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, 20. Which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies , 21. Far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come; 22. And He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church , 23. Which is His Body , the fullness of the One who fills all in all.

        4. This perfecting will cause us to be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to the satanic system of error—Eph. 4:14.
            Eph. 4:14: 14. That we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error,

        5. This perfecting will cause every member of the Body of Christ to be a building mem- ber in love—growing up into the Head and functioning out from the Head—vv. 15-16.
II. Ephesians 6:10-20 reveals that Christ is the constituents of God’s armor:
    Ephesians 6:10-20: 10. Finally , be empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength. 11. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil , 12. For our wrestling is not against blood and flesh but against the rulers , against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness , against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies . 13. Therefore take up the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand . 14. Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth and having put on the breastplate of righteousness 15. And having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace ; 16. Besides all these, having taken up the shield of faith , with which you will be able to quench all the flaming darts of the evil one. 17. And receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, 18. By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints, 19. And for me, that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth, to make known in boldness the mystery of the gospel, 20. For which I am an ambassador in a chain , that in it I would speak boldly , as I ought to speak.

    A. The whole armor of God is for the entire Body of Christ as the corporate warrior, not for any individual member of the Body; we must fight the spiritual warfare in the Body, not as individuals—vv. 10-13; James 4:7; cf. Rom. 13:12-14; Deut. 32:30.
         James 4:7: 7. Be subject therefore to God; but withstand the devil , and he will flee from you.
         Rom. 13:12-14: 12. The night is far advanced, and the day has drawn near. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the weapons of light. 13. Let us walk becomingly as in the day ; not in reveling and drunkenness , not in fornication and licentiousness, not in strife and jealousy . 14. But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill its lusts.
         Deut. 32:30: 30. How shall one chase a thousand, And two put ten thousand to flight, Were it not that their Rock sold them, And Jehovah delivered them up?

    B. In Ephesians 2 we sit with Christ in the heavenlies to participate in all His accom- plishments (v. 6); in chapters 4 and 5 we walk in His Body on the earth to fulfill God’s eternal purpose (4:1, 17; 5:2, 8, 15); then in chapter 6 we stand in His power in the heavenlies to fight against God’s enemy (vv. 11, 13-14; cf. 1 John 5:4, 18; John 3:6b).
        1 John 5:4: 4. For everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world ; and this is the victory which has overcome the world—our faith .
         John 3:6: 6. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit .

    C. “Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth”—Eph. 6:14a:
        Eph. 6:14: 14. Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth and having put on the breastplate of righteousness

        1. Truth here refers to God in Christ as the reality in our living, that is, God realized and experienced by us in our living; this is actually Christ Himself lived out by us— 4:15, 21, 24-25; John 14:6; 8:31-32, 36.
             John 14:6: 6. Jesus said to him, I am the way and the reality and the life ; no one comes to the Father except through Me.

        2. The truth with which we are girded is actually the Christ whom we experience; because Paul’s living was conformed to the pattern of Christ, he had the strength to face all opposition and adverse circumstances—Eph. 4:20-21; Phil. 1:19-21a.
            Eph. 4:20-21: 20. But you did not so learn Christ, 21. If indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus,
             Phil. 1:19-21: 19. For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 20. According to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame , but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death . 21. For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain .

    D. “Having put on the breastplate of righteousness”—Eph. 6:14b; 1 Cor. 1:30; Jer. 23:6:
        Eph. 6:14: 14. Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth and having put on the breastplate of righteousness
        1 Cor. 1:30: 30. But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption ,
         Jer. 23:6: 6. In His days Judah will be saved, And Israel will dwell securely; And this is His name by which He will be called, Jehovah our righteousness.

        1. Christ as the breastplate of righteousness covers our conscience, signified by the breast; in fighting against Satan, our accuser, we need a blood-purified conscience, a conscience void of offense—Heb. 9:14; 10:22; Acts 24:16.
            Heb. 9:14: 14. How much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?
             Acts 24:16: 16. Because of this I also exercise myself to always have a conscience without offense toward God and men.

        2. “They overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb” (Rev. 12:11); our response to Satan’s accusations should be, “I overcome Satan, the accuser, not by my perfection and not even by a conscience void of offense but by the blood of the Lamb; I am defended against his accusations by the breastplate of righteousness.”
            Rev. 12:11: 11. And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death.

    E. “Having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace”—Eph. 6:15:
        Eph. 6:15: 15. And having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace ;

        1. Christ has made peace for us on the cross, both with God and with man, and this peace has become our gospel; the gospel of peace has been established as a firm foundation, as a readiness with which our feet may be shod—2:13-17.
        2. We fight the spiritual warfare by standing in peace; if we lose the peace between us and God or between us and other believers, we lose the standing to fight—Col. 3:15.
            Col. 3:15: 15. And let the peace of Christ arbitrate in your hearts, to which also you were called in one Body; and be thankful .

    F. “Besides all these, having taken up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the flaming darts of the evil one”—Eph. 6:16; 2 Cor. 4:13; Heb. 12:2:
        Eph. 6:16: 16. Besides all these, having taken up the shield of faith , with which you will be able to quench all the flaming darts of the evil one.
        2 Cor. 4:13: 13. And having the same spirit of faith according to that which is written, “I believed, therefore I spoke,” we also believe, therefore we also speak,
         Heb. 12:2: 2. Looking away unto Jesus , the Author and Perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross , despising the shame , and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God.

        1. The flaming darts are Satan’s temptations, proposals, doubts, questions, lies, and attacks; we need to take up the shield of faith to quench these flaming darts.
        2. We need to exercise our spirit of faith with our subdued and resurrected will to believe that the Lord’s manifestation is to destroy the works of the devil—1 John 3:8; Matt. 16:22-23; Luke 4:39-41; Matt. 12:28; Luke 10:17, 19.
            1 John 3:8: 8. He who practices sin is of the devil , because the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested , that He might destroy the works of the devil.
             Matt. 16:22-23: 22. And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You! 23. But He turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan ! You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men.
             Luke 4:39-41: 39. And standing over her, He rebuked the fever, and it left her. And she instantly rose up and served them. 40. And when the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and He laid His hands on each one of them and healed them. 41. And demons also came out from many, crying out and saying, You are the Son of God! And He rebuked them and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that He was the Christ .
             Matt. 12:28: 28. But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
             Luke 10:17: 17. And the seventy returned with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name.

        3. We need to exercise our spirit of faith to believe that the Lord’s death has destroyed Satan—Heb. 2:14; Gen. 2:17; 3:15; Gal. 2:20; Rom. 6:3-6; 1 Cor. 15:54-58.
            Heb. 2:14: 14. Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death , that is, the devil ,
             Gen. 2:17: 17. But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, of it you shall not eat; for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die .
             Gal. 2:20: 20. I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith , the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me.
             Rom. 6:3-6: 3. Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? 4. We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life . 5. For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection, 6. Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled , that we should no longer serve sin as slaves;
            1 Cor. 15:54-58: 54. And when this corruptible will put on incorruption and this mortal will put on immortality, then the word which is written will come to pass, “Death has been swallowed up unto victory .” 55. Where , O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting ? 56. The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law . 57. But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 58. Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast , immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.

        4. We need to exercise our spirit of faith to believe that the Lord’s resurrection has put Satan to shame—Col. 2:12-15, 20; 3:1; John 14:30; Phil. 3:10; Isa. 61:10; Zech. 3:4-5.
            Col. 2:12-15: 12. Buried together with Him in baptism, in which also you were raised together with Him through the faith of the operation of God, who raised Him from the dead. 13. And you, though dead in your offenses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, He made alive together with Him, having forgiven us all our offenses; 14. Wiping out the handwriting in ordinances , which was against us, which was contrary to us; and He has taken it out of the way, nailing it to the cross. 15. Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it .
             John 14:30: 30. I will no longer speak much with you, for the ruler of the world is coming, and in Me he has nothing;
             Phil. 3:10: 10. To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,
             Isa. 61:10: 10. I will rejoice greatly in Jehovah, My soul will exult in my God; For He has clothed me with the garments of salvation, He has wrapped me with the robe of righteousness; I am like a bridegroom who wears the headdress of the priest, And like a bride who adorns herself with her jewels.
             Zech. 3:4-5: 4. And He answered and spoke to those standing before Him, saying, Remove the filthy garments from him. Then He said to him, See, I hereby make your iniquity pass from you and clothe you with stately robes. 5. And He said, Let them put a clean turban upon his head. And they put the clean turban upon his head and clothed him with garments while the Angel of Jehovah stood by.

        5. We need to exercise our spirit of faith to believe that the ascension of the Lord is far above Satan’s power—Eph. 1:19-23; 2:6; 6:11, 13. 6. We must have faith in God, who is real, living, present, and available—Mark 11:22;
Rev. 1:18.
7. We must have faith in God’s heart; God’s heart toward us is always good; He has no
intention to punish us, to injure us, or to cause us to suffer loss—Rom. 8:28-39.
8. We must have faith in God’s faithfulness; God cannot lie but is always faithful to
His word—1 Cor. 1:9; 1 John 1:9; Titus 1:2.
9. We must have faith in God’s ability—Eph. 3:20.
10. We must have faith in God’s word; God is bound to fulfill all that He has spoken—
cf. 1 Thes. 5:24; Eph. 6:17-18.
11. We must have faith in God’s will—1:5, 9, 11.
12. We must have faith in God’s sovereignty; under His sovereignty even our mistakes
work for good—Rom. 9:19-29.
G. “Receive the helmet of salvation”—Eph. 6:17a:
1. The helmet of salvation is for covering our mind, our mentality, against the negative
thoughts shot in by the evil one; such a helmet, such a covering, is God’s salvation.
2. Satan injects threats, worries, anxieties, fears, and other weakening thoughts into our
mind; God’s salvation is the covering that we take up against all of these, and this
salvation is the saving Christ whom we experience in our daily life—John 16:33;
Phil. 1:19; Rom. 5:10; 10:12-13.
H. Receive “the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God”—Eph. 6:17b:
1. Among the six items of God’s armor, the sword of the Spirit is the only one for attack-
ing the enemy; with the sword we cut the enemy to pieces.
2. Christ as the Spirit and the word furnishes us with a sword as an offensive weapon
to defeat and slay the enemy.
3. When the logos (the constant word in the Bible) becomes the rhema (the present, in-
stant, living speaking of the Spirit) to us, this rhema is the sword that cuts the enemy
to pieces—cf. John 6:63.
I. “By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto
this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints”—Eph. 6:18:
1. Prayer may be considered the seventh item of the armor of God, because it is the
means by which we apply the other items.
2. Prayer is the unique way to apply Christ as the armor of God; it is prayer that makes
the armor available to us in a practical way.

            Eph. 1:19-23: 19. And what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, 20. Which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies , 21. Far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come; 22. And He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church , 23. Which is His Body , the fullness of the One who fills all in all.
            Mark 11:22: 22. And Jesus answered and said to them, Have faith in God.
            
Rev. 1:18: 18. And the living One; and I became dead , and behold, I am living forever and ever; and I have the keys of death and of Hades.
            Rom. 8:28-39: 28. And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose . 29. Because those whom He foreknew , He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers ; 30. And those whom He predestinated, these He also called; and those whom He called, these He also justified ; and those whom He justified, these He also glorified . 31. What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 32. Indeed, He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not also with Him freely give us all things? 33. Who shall bring a charge against God’s chosen ones? It is God who justifies . 34. Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died and, rather, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us. 35. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword? 36. As it is written, “For Your sake we are being put to death all day long; we have been accounted as sheep for slaughter.” 37. But in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us. 38. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers 39. Nor height nor depth nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
            1 Cor. 1:9: 9. God is faithful , through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
            1 John 1:9: 9. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness .
             Titus 1:2: 2. In the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the times of the ages
            Eph. 3:20: 20. But to Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us,
            1 Thes. 5:24: 24. Faithful is He who calls you, who also will do it .
             Eph. 6:17-18: 17. And receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, 18. By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints,
            Rom. 9:19-29: 19. You will say to me then, Why does He still find fault? For who withstands His will? 20. But rather, O man, who are you who answer back to God? Shall the thing molded say to him who molded it, Why did you make me thus? 21. Or does not the potter have authority over the clay to make out of the same lump one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor? 22. And what if God, wishing to demonstrate His wrath and make His power known, endured with much long-suffering vessels of wrath fitted for destruction, 23. In order that He might make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy , which He had before prepared unto glory , 24. Even us, whom He has also called , not only from among the Jews but also from among the Gentiles? 25. As He also says in Hosea, “I will call those who were not My people My people, and her who was not beloved beloved; 26. And it shall be that in the place where it was said to them, You are not My people, there shall they be called sons of the living God.” 27. And Isaiah cries concerning Israel, “Though the number of the sons of Israel be like the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that shall be saved; 28. For the Lord will execute His word upon the earth, accomplishing it and cutting it short.” 29. And as Isaiah has previously said, “Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom and been made like Gomorrah.”
            Eph. 6:17: 17. And receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God,
            John 16:33: 33. These things I have spoken to you that in Me you may have peace . In the world you have affliction , but take courage; I have overcome the world.
            
Phil. 1:19: 19. For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
             Rom. 5:10: 10. For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life , having been reconciled,
             John 6:63: 63. It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.
            Eph. 6:18: 18. By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints,

        6. We must have faith in God, who is real, living, present, and available—Mark 11:22; Rev. 1:18.
            Mark 11:22: 22. And Jesus answered and said to them, Have faith in God.
             Rev. 1:18: 18. And the living One; and I became dead , and behold, I am living forever and ever; and I have the keys of death and of Hades.

        7. We must have faith in God’s heart; God’s heart toward us is always good; He has no intention to punish us, to injure us, or to cause us to suffer loss—Rom. 8:28-39.
            Rom. 8:28-39: 28. And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose . 29. Because those whom He foreknew , He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers ; 30. And those whom He predestinated, these He also called; and those whom He called, these He also justified ; and those whom He justified, these He also glorified . 31. What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? 32. Indeed, He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not also with Him freely give us all things? 33. Who shall bring a charge against God’s chosen ones?

Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword? 36. As it is written, “For Your sake we are being put to death all day long; we have been accounted as sheep for slaughter.” 37. But in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us. 38. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers 39. Nor height nor depth nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

        8. We must have faith in God’s faithfulness; God cannot lie but is always faithful to His word—1 Cor. 1:9; 1 John 1:9; Titus 1:2.
            1 Cor. 1:9: 9. God is faithful , through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

        9. We must have faith in God’s ability—Eph. 3:20.
            Eph. 3:20: 20. But to Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us,

        10. We must have faith in God’s word; God is bound to fulfill all that He has spoken— cf. 1 Thes. 5:24; Eph. 6:17-18.
            1 Thes. 5:24: 24. Faithful is He who calls you, who also will do it .
             Eph. 6:17-18: 17. And receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, 18. By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints,

And it shall be that in the place where it was said to them, You are not My people, there shall they be called sons of the living God.” 27. And Isaiah cries concerning Israel, “Though the number of the sons of Israel be like the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that shall be saved; 28. For the Lord will execute His word upon the earth, accomplishing it and cutting it short.” 29. And as Isaiah has previously said, “Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom and been made like Gomorrah.”

    G. “Receive the helmet of salvation”—Eph. 6:17a:
        Eph. 6:17: 17. And receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God,

        1. The helmet of salvation is for covering our mind, our mentality, against the negative thoughts shot in by the evil one; such a helmet, such a covering, is God’s salvation.
        2. Satan injects threats, worries, anxieties, fears, and other weakening thoughts into our mind; God’s salvation is the covering that we take up against all of these, and this salvation is the saving Christ whom we experience in our daily life—John 16:33; Phil. 1:19; Rom. 5:10; 10:12-13.
            John 16:33: 33. These things I have spoken to you that in Me you may have peace . In the world you have affliction , but take courage; I have overcome the world.
             Phil. 1:19: 19. For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
             Rom. 5:10: 10. For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life , having been reconciled,

    H. Receive “the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God”—Eph. 6:17b:
        Eph. 6:17: 17. And receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God,

        1. Among the six items of God’s armor, the sword of the Spirit is the only one for attack- ing the enemy; with the sword we cut the enemy to pieces.
        2. Christ as the Spirit and the word furnishes us with a sword as an offensive weapon to defeat and slay the enemy.
        3. When the logos (the constant word in the Bible) becomes the rhema (the present, in- stant, living speaking of the Spirit) to us, this rhema is the sword that cuts the enemy to pieces—cf. John 6:63.
             John 6:63: 63. It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.

I. “By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints”—Eph. 6:18:
    Eph. 6:18: 18. By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints,

    1. Prayer may be considered the seventh item of the armor of God, because it is the means by which we apply the other items.
    2. Prayer is the unique way to apply Christ as the armor of God; it is prayer that makes the armor available to us in a practical way. © 2024 Living Stream Ministry
