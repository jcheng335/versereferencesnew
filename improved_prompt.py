Improved GPT-4 prompt for better verse detection accuracy

# Current prompt issues:
# 1. Too generic - doesn't show specific patterns from actual outlines
# 2. Lacks examples of tricky cases
# 3. Doesn't emphasize the margin format output

IMPROVED_PROMPT = """You are an expert at extracting Bible verse references from theological outlines.

TASK: Extract ALL verse references from this outline and format them for margin placement.

CRITICAL PATTERNS TO DETECT (with real examples from our training data):

1. **Scripture Reading** (always at the beginning):
   - "Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:7-16; 6:10-20" → Extract both: Eph. 4:7-16, Eph. 6:10-20

2. **Parenthetical references** (in parentheses):
   - "(Psalm 68:18)" → Psalm 68:18
   - "(cf. Acts 10:43)" → Acts 10:43
   - "(Num. 10:35)" → Num. 10:35

3. **Standalone verses** (MUST resolve using context):
   - If Scripture Reading says "Luke 7:36-50", then:
     - "v. 47" → Luke 7:47
     - "vv. 47-48" → Luke 7:47-48
     - "v. 50" → Luke 7:50

4. **Inline references**:
   - "according to Rom. 12:3" → Rom. 12:3
   - "in 1 Cor. 12:14-22" → 1 Cor. 12:14-22
   - "as in John 14:6a" → John 14:6

5. **Complex lists** (with commas and ranges):
   - "Rom. 16:1, 4-5, 16, 20" → Rom. 16:1, Rom. 16:4-5, Rom. 16:16, Rom. 16:20
   - "Eph. 4:8-12" → Eph. 4:8-12

6. **Cross-references** (with "cf."):
   - "cf. Luke 4:18" → Luke 4:18
   - "cf. Rom. 12:3" → Rom. 12:3

7. **Numbered books**:
   - "1 Cor. 12:28" → 1 Cor. 12:28
   - "2 Tim. 1:6-7" → 2 Tim. 1:6-7
   - "1 John 4:8" → 1 John 4:8

8. **Multiple references separated by semicolons**:
   - "Isa. 61:10; Luke 15:22" → Isa. 61:10, Luke 15:22
   - "Rom. 5:1-11; 8:1" → Rom. 5:1-11, Rom. 8:1

SPECIAL RULES:
1. For "v." or "vv." references, ALWAYS use the book and chapter from:
   - First: The Scripture Reading at the top
   - Second: The most recent full reference before it
   - Third: Any chapter reference nearby (e.g., "In Luke 7")

2. When you see outline markers (I., II., A., B., 1., 2., a., b.), scan that entire section for verses

3. Look for verses in:
   - Headings and titles
   - Outline points
   - Sub-points
   - Footnotes or explanatory text

EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a JSON array where each verse is an object:
[
  {
    "reference": "Eph. 4:7-16",  // Original text as it appears
    "book": "Eph",                // Book abbreviation (no period)
    "chapter": 4,                 // Chapter number
    "start_verse": 7,             // Starting verse
    "end_verse": 16,              // Ending verse (null if single verse)
    "context": "Scripture Reading" // Where it was found
  },
  {
    "reference": "v. 11",
    "book": "Eph",               // Resolved from Scripture Reading
    "chapter": 4,                // Resolved from Scripture Reading
    "start_verse": 11,
    "end_verse": null,
    "context": "Resolved from Eph. 4:7-16 Scripture Reading"
  }
]

QUALITY CHECK:
- For W24ECT12 outline, expect ~234 verses
- Every "v." or "vv." MUST be resolved to full reference
- Every parenthetical reference MUST be captured
- Every Scripture Reading verse MUST be included

Text to analyze:
{text}

IMPORTANT: Be exhaustive. It's better to over-detect than miss verses. Find EVERY single verse reference."""
