380. 2 Corinthians 13:14
381. 2 Corinthians 13:14.
b. The current of the Divine Trinity within us as revealed in 2 Corinthians 13:14 is
our spiritual pulse.
2. The blessing in 2 Corinthians 13:14 is the same as that in Numbers 6:22-27
382. 2 Corinthians 4:4
383. 2 Corinthians 4:6
384. 2 Corinthians 4:6 is the same word
translated “person” in 2:10, which refers to the part around the eyes, the
look as the index of the inward thoughts and feelings, which shows forth and
manifests the whole person.
4. This indicates that unless we have the index of Christ’s face, He cannot be a
treasure to us in reality:
a. We will not sense that we have a treasure within us until we see the
face of Jesus Christ.
b. On the one hand, we can all declare that we are the earthen vessels and
that Christ is the treasure within us.
c. On the other hand, we need to see that it is only when we are living in
the presence of Christ, looking at the index of His being, that we will
sense that He is a treasure to us-v. 10.
F. The first step of God’s procedure in fulfilling His purpose was to create man as
an earthen vessel to contain Himself as life-Gen. 2:7:
1. God chose us so that we may be vessels of honor filled with the Triune God-
Rom. 9:21, 23; 2 Cor. 13:14.
2. The New Testament shows us that God wants believers as vessels loving
Him and keeping themselves open to Him-Rom. 9:21, 23; 2 Cor. 3:16.
3. If in the depths of our being we are not open to the Lord, He cannot dis-
pense Himself into us and make His home in our heart-1 Cor. 2:10.
4. An open vessel is doing nothing but keeping itself open to be filled by the
divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity-2 Cor. 13:14.
5. When the Lord fills us, He does everything for us-Eph. 3:19.
G. We are weak because we are earthen vessels
385. 2 Corinthians 4:7
386. 2 Corinthians 4:7 refers to verse 6, where Paul
speaks of the face of Jesus Christ:
1. The shining of God in our hearts is to illuminate us that we may know the
glory of God in Christ’s face.
2. The glory of God manifested in the face of Jesus Christ is the God of glory
expressed through Jesus Christ
387. 2 Pet. 1:4
388. 2 Pet. 1:4.
389. 2 Pet. 1:4.
F. Because we are the children of God with the life and nature of God, we can be
imitators of God-Eph. 5:1.
G. As the Father’s children, having the Father’s life and nature, we can be perfect as
our Father is perfect-Matt. 5:48.
III. We need to know and experience God as love and light-1 John 4:8, 16
390. 2 Sam. 7:12-14a; Matt. 22:42-45; Rom. 1:3;
Rev. 22:16; Acts 2:30-31; Matt. 16:16-18; Rev. 20:4, 6
391. 2 Tim. 3:2-4
392. 2 Tim. 3:2-4.
393. 2 Tim. 3:2-4.
2. We need to be constrained by the love of Christ to love God and the saints with
Christ as our love-2 Cor. 5:14.
B. “If God is for us, who can be against us?”-Rom. 8:31; Jer. 31:31-34; Heb. 8:8-10:
1. “I will make an eternal covenant with them that I will not turn away from them, to
do them good
394. 2 Tim. 4:22
395. 2. A CHAPTER FOR DESPERATE SEEKERS-Romans 7:24-25a; Romans 8:2.
396. 2. According to Ephesians 3:4, the church has a particular title-the mystery
397. 2. Christ is the mystery of God-Col. 2:2.
398. 2. Faith comes out of the hearing of the word-Rom. 10:17.
399. 2. He was the only begotten Son of God from eternity-John 1:18; 3:16.
400. 2. In Romans 1:3-4 Christ, the Son of God, is the prototype, whereas in 8:29 the
401. 2. In Romans 8:34 it is Christ who intercedes for us, yet in verse 26 it is the Spirit who
402. 2. Manna is a long-term miracle-Exo. 16:4; cf. Matt. 6:34.
403. 2. The blessing in 2 Corinthians 13:14 is the same as that in Numbers 6:22-27; this is
404. 2. To call upon the name of the Lord implies to believe into Him-Rom. 10:14.
405. 2. We can mind the things of the Spirit-setting our mind on the spirit-Rom. 8:5-6:
406. 2. We have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand-Rom. 5:2a.

909. Eph. 2:15

2. “In Himself” as the sphere, element, and essence, Christ created the Jews and the
Gentiles into one new man:
a. Christ is not only the Creator of the one new man, the church, but also the sphere
in which and the element and essence with which the new man was created.
b. Christ is the very element and essence of the one new man, making God’s divine
nature one entity with humanity-cf. Col. 3:10-11.
B. In the creating of the new man, first our natural man was crucified by Christ, and then
through the crossing out of the old man, Christ imparted the divine element into us,
causing us to become the masterpiece of God’s work, an absolutely new item in the uni-
verse, a new invention of God-Rom. 6:6; 2 Cor. 5:17:
1. The Greek word for masterpiece is poiema, meaning “something that has been writ-
ten or composed as a poem.”
2. Not only a poetic writing may be considered a poem, but also any work of art that
expresses the maker’s wisdom and design.
3. We, the church, the masterpiece of God’s work, are a poem expressing God’s infinite
wisdom and divine design
911. Eph. 2:2
912. Eph. 2:2), has blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers:
1. The god of this age is Satan, the ruler of the present age, who dominates
today’s world and hunts for people’s worship by blinding their mind and
thoughts-2 Cor. 4:4.
2. All people today, whether primitive or highly cultured, have been blinded
by the god of this age.
3. We need to pray, “Lord, I trust in You to defeat the god of this age
913. Eph. 2:7; 1 Pet.

915. Eph. 3:10-11.
916. Eph. 3:10-11.
4. Christ became wisdom to us from God as three vital things in God’s salvation-
1 Cor. 1:30:
a. He is our righteousness (for our past), by which we have been justified by God,
that we might be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life-Rom. 5:18
917. Eph. 3:14-17
918. Eph. 3:14-17).
2. A CHAPTER FOR DESPERATE SEEKERS-Romans 7:24-25a; Romans 8:2.
3. THE KEY TO BEING A CHRISTIAN-living in the realm of impossibility (the realm of
resurrection)-Romans 8:2-4-“For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the
law of sin and of death. For that which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh,
God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in
the flesh, that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk
according to the flesh but according to the spirit.” This shows that the law of the Spirit of life even
includes an element that deals with impossibility-vv. 10, 6, 11
919. Eph. 3:17a
920. Eph. 3:17a.
D. To have Christ formed in us is to allow the all-inclusive Spirit to occupy every
part of our inner being-Gal. 4:19
921. Eph. 3:17a; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29
922. Eph. 3:17a; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29; 12:2a

928. Eph. 3:21a; Rev.
21:11a; Isa. 43:7.
II. Philippians 2:2 says, “Thinking the one thing.” “The one thing” is the subjective
knowledge and experience of Christ for our enjoyment.
III. To think something other than the one thing is to rebel against God’s economy

D. “Having put on the breastplate of righteousness”-Eph. 6:14b; 1 Cor. 1:30; Jer. 23:6:
1. Christ as the breastplate of righteousness covers our conscience, signified by the
breast
940. Eph. 4:22-24
941. Eph. 4:22-24.
IV. For and in the one new man, we need to allow the peace of Christ to arbitrate in
our hearts-2:14a, 15b; Col. 3:12-15
942. Eph. 4:23
943. Eph. 4:23.
2. Christ must permeate us and saturate us until He is completely blended with
us
944. Eph. 4:3
945. Eph. 4:3.
946. Eph. 4:3.
V. In the one new man Christ is all the members and is in all the members-Col.

950. Eph. 5:1
951. Eph. 5:2
952. Eph. 5:2, 8
953. Eph. 5:2, 8:
A. As grace and truth are the basic elements in 4:17-32, so love and light are the
basic elements of Paul’s exhortation in 5:1-33:
1. Grace is the expression of love, and love is the source of grace
954. Eph. 5:2:
1. To walk in love is to walk in intimacy with God-cf. 1 John 3:1:
a. In the Father’s presence, we not only enjoy grace, the expression of love,
but we also enjoy love itself.
b. In our daily walk we should always care for our Father’s feeling, for we live
intimately in His tender love.
2. The goal of the book of Ephesians is to bring us into love as the inner sub-
stance of God that we may enjoy His presence in the sweetness of the divine
love and thereby love others as Christ did-5:25:
a. In the condition and atmosphere of love, we are saturated with God to be
holy and without blemish before Him-1:4.
b. The love in which we are rooted for growth and grounded for building is
the divine love realized and experienced by us in a practical way-3:17.
c. The love of Christ, which is Christ Himself, is immeasurable and knowledge-
surpassing, yet we can know it by experiencing it-v. 19.
d. In the love of God in Christ, we hold to truth, that is, to Christ with His
Body-4:15.
e. The Body of Christ builds itself up in love
955. Eph. 5:32
956. Eph. 5:32.
6. Our spirit needs to be strong and full of wisdom and revelation so that we
may know the mystery of the church-1:17.
7. The mystery of Christ and the mystery of the church are great and deep.
B. The great mystery-Christ and the church-is the meaning of the universe
and of human life-Rev. 4:11; Eph. 5:32:
1. God’s intention in His creation of all things, including man, was that man
would be mingled with God to produce the church-Zech. 12:1; Eph. 3:9.
2. The desire of God’s heart is to have the mystery of Christ-the Body of
Christ as the increase and expression of Christ-1:5, 9, 11, 22-23.
3. The Body life is the ultimate satisfaction of our spiritual experience-5:30.
4. The economy of the mystery hidden in God throughout the ages is the mys-
tery of the church as the Body of Christ-3:9-10.
5. The mystery of Christ and the mystery of the church should be our daily
life
957. Eph. 5:8
958. Eph. 5:8:
959. Eph. 5:8:
1. As God is light, so we, the children of God, are children of light-1 John 1:5;
Eph. 5:8; John 12:36.
2. We are not only children of light-we are light itself
960. Eph. 5:8; John 12:36.

966. Eph. 6:17-18
967. Eph. 6:17-18.
4. We need to be full of the revelation of the Son of God and thereby become a
new creation with Christ living in us, being formed in us, and being enjoyed
by us continually as the all-inclusive Spirit-Gal. 6:14-15.
B. The way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-
inclusive life-giving Spirit is by our receiving of Christ out of the hearing of
faith-3:2:
1. The faith of the believers is Christ entering into them to be their faith,
making their spirit a spirit of faith-Heb. 12:2a; Gal. 2:16; Rom. 3:22; 2 Cor.
4:13.
2. Faith comes out of the hearing of the word-Rom. 10:17.
3. Faith is to believe that God is and we are not
968. Eph. 6:17a
969. Eph. 6:17b
970. Eph. 6:17b:
1. Among the six items of God’s armor, the sword of the Spirit is the only one for attack-
ing the enemy

d. The blood of the covenant ushers us into the presence of God in the Holy of
Holies, where we behold His beauty, into the infusion and transfusion of God,
and into the eternal enjoyment of God
1005. Ezek. 36:26-27; Prov. 30:18-19; Isa. 40:28-31; Heb. 12:2a; Phil. 4:13; Col. 1:28-29.
1006. F. Colossians 1:15 speaks of Christ as “the image of the invisible God”; the image
1007. F. In all the sufferings we more than conquer through Christ who loved us-v. 37:
1008. F. When we experience the crucified Christ, we are terminated-Gal. 2:20:
1009. First Corinthians 1:2 mentions “the called saints”:
1010. First John says that God is light (v. 5) and then that God is love (4:8, 16).
1011. G. The word formed in Galatians 4:19 corresponds to the word image in 2 Corin-
1012. G. “Receive the helmet of salvation”-Eph. 6:17a:
1013. Gal.
2:20; Eph. 3:17a
1014. Gal.
2:20; Eph. 3:17a.
3. For the practical existence of the one new man, the total person of the old man must
be put away, and we must live by our new person-Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20; Eph. 4:22-24
1015. Gal.
4:19
1016. Gal.
4:5-6
1017. Gal.
4:5-6).
B. In Galatians 2:20 we see the most basic truth of God’s economy-no longer I but
Christ living in me:
1. When Christ was crucified according to God’s economy, we were included in
Him
1018. Gal. 1:15-16
1019. Gal. 1:15a, 16a
1020. Gal. 1:15a, 16a; 2 Cor. 3:14-17
1021. Gal. 2:20
1022. Gal. 2:20.
D. The crucified Christ is the power of God-1 Cor. 1:24:
1. In the cross of Christ we see God’s power.
2. It takes the power of God to defeat Satan, the world, sin, fallen man, the flesh,
the natural life, the old creation, and the ordinances.
3. The death of Christ-His crucifixion-has become the power of God-v. 24.
E. The crucified Christ is the wisdom of God-2:7:
1. In order to accomplish anything, we need Christ as both power and wisdom-
1:24.
2. Wisdom is for planning and purposing, whereas power is for carrying out and
accomplishing what is planned and purposed.
3. When we experience the crucified Christ, He becomes to us not only the power
of God but also the wisdom of God-Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20.
4. The crucified Christ as God’s wisdom is related to God’s deep and profound plan
according to His good pleasure and also according to God’s way to fulfill His
will-Eph. 1:9, 11
1023. Gal. 2:20.
IV. “That the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us”-2 Cor.
4:7b:
A. The fact that we are earthen vessels proves that the excellency of the power is
of God and not out of us:
1. In ourselves we are nothing more than earthen vessels
1024. Gal. 2:20:
1. All that we are, all that we have, and all that we can do-all is completely ter-
minated.
2. When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, as we are experiencing and enjoy-
ing Him, His crucifixion will terminate us.
3. Christ crucified is not only the power but also the way for us to be delivered
from the flesh, the natural life, and the old creation.
II. As those who are called by God, we need to know and experience Christ’s
power and wisdom-1 Cor. 1:24:
A. First Corinthians 1:2 mentions “the called saints”:
1. The believers in Christ are called saints, not called to be saints
1025. Gal. 2:20;
1 Cor. 5:7
1026. Gal. 2:20; Col. 3:4, 10-11
1027. Gal. 2:20; Col. 3:4, 10-11.
2. Eventually, our whole being will be constituted with the element of Christ, for
He will constitute every part of our soul so that we may have His form, His
image, in every part of our being-2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29.
G. The word formed in Galatians 4:19 corresponds to the word image in 2 Corin-
thians 3:18:
1. Christ with His element is working within us organically so that we may have
His form and express His image-Rom. 8:29.
2. Christ’s being formed in us depends on our being transformed into His image-
2 Cor. 3:18.
3. Our being transformed into His image and His being formed in us cause us to
be conformed to His image
1028. Gal. 2:20; Rom. 6:3-6; 1 Cor. 15:54-58
1029. Gal. 2:20; Rom. 6:3-6; 1 Cor. 15:54-58.
4. We need to exercise our spirit of faith to believe that the Lord’s resurrection has put
Satan to shame-Col. 2:12-15, 20
1030. Gal. 2:20a; Rom. 7:15-20
1031. Gal. 2:4
1032. Gal. 3:1
1033. Gal. 3:1) to redeem us out of the curse of the law (v. 13)
and rescue us out of the evil religious course of the world (1:4), and He was
resurrected from the dead so that He might live in us (2:20) and be formed
in us at our maturity (4:19).
III. In Galatians 4:19 Christ is presented as the One who is formed in the believ-
ers:
A. Christ, a living person, is the focus of Paul’s gospel-1:16; Rom. 1:1, 3-4.
B. Paul’s preaching was to bring forth Christ, the Son of the living God, in the
believers-Gal. 1:15-16
1034. Gal. 3:14, 16, 29; John 14:17-20; 1 Cor. 15:45b;
John 12:24; Isa. 53:10
1035. Gal. 3:14, 16, 29; John 14:17-20; 1 Cor. 15:45b;
John 12:24; Isa. 53:10.
C. Christ as the seed of David refers to the resurrected Christ, who carries out
God’s New Testament economy for the dispensing of the processed Triune God
into the members of His Body so that they may share His kingship in His res-
urrection in the eternal kingdom-2 Sam. 7:12-14a; Matt. 22:42-45; Rom. 1:3;
Rev. 22:16; Acts 2:30-31; Matt. 16:16-18; Rev. 20:4, 6:
1. The great mountain, the kingdom of God that fills the whole earth in Daniel
2:34-35, is the corporate threefold seed in humanity, which includes all the
believers in Christ-cf. Mark 4:26.
2. Through Christ as the threefold seed in humanity, the enemies are gone,
the blessing is here, and we are in the kingdom
1036. Gal. 3:14, 26, 29
1037. Gal. 3:29
1038. Gal. 3:5a; Col. 4:2; Rom. 10:12-13
1039. Gal. 4:19.
F. Paul’s word about Christ being formed in the believers implies that we are being
constituted with Christ-Col. 1:27
1040. Gal. 4:19;
Eph. 4:13-16
1041. Gal. 4:19;
Eph. 4:13-16:
A. First, Christ was born into us at the time we repented and believed into Him,
then He lives in us in our Christian life (Gal. 2:20), and finally, He will be formed
in us at our maturity.
B. To have Christ formed in us is to allow Him to permeate our whole being and
saturate our inward parts-4:19; Eph. 3:17a; Col. 3:4, 10-11:
1. When Christ occupies our inner being in this way, He is formed in us-Psa.
51:6.
2. We need to allow Christ to saturate every part of our inner being
1042. Gal. 4:19; Rom. 8:29
1043. Gal. 4:19; Rom. 8:29.
H. To have Christ formed in us is to have the three parts of our soul-our mind, emo-
tion, and will-renewed-12:2a; Eph. 4:23:
1. In order for our mind, emotion, and will to be renewed, Christ must saturate
our mind, emotion, and will and replace the self and the world in our soul with
Himself-Rom. 12:2a.
2. If we are renewed in this way, every part of our inner being will bear the
image of Christ-2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29.
VI. Christ needs to be formed in us so that we may be sons of full age and heirs
to inherit God’s promised blessing and so that we may mature in the divine
sonship-Gal. 3:14, 26, 29
1044. Gal. 5:16, 25

1048. Gal. 6:14-15
1049. Gal. 6:17
1050. Gal. 6:17:
1. Manna is a mystery-Exo. 16:15; Col. 2:2; Isa. 9:6; Eph. 3:4; John 3:8.
2. Manna is a long-term miracle-Exo. 16:4
1051. Gal. 6:18; Phil. 4:23; Philem. 25; 2 Tim. 4:22; cf. 1:6-7.
1052. Galatians 1:16
1053. Galatians 1:16 is crucial and of utmost importance.
2. To reveal is to make known (divulge) or to show plainly (display) something
that has been kept secret.
3. In the New Testament revealed is used in a profound manner related to our
spirit-Rom. 1:17
1054. Galatians 2:20
1055. Galatians 3:26
1056. Galatians 3:26 says, “You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus”

1059. Gen.
11:5-9; Acts 2:5-12; Col. 3:10-11.
II. The new man as the poem, the masterpiece, of God was created through Christ’s
death and in His resurrection-Eph. 2:10, 15-16:
A. We need to pay careful attention to two phrases in verse 15: in His flesh and in Himself:
1. “In His flesh” Christ terminated all the negative things in the universe: Satan, the
devil, the enemy of God (Heb. 2:14)
1060. Gen. 11:1-9
1061. Gen. 11:1-9:

1069. Gen. 1:26; Eph. 2:15:
A. God created man in His own image for His expression and gave man His dominion so
that man would represent Him to deal with His enemy-Gen. 1:26.
B. The church as the new man in the new creation bears God’s image for God’s expression
and fights against God’s enemy for God’s kingdom-Col. 3:10-11; Eph. 2:15
1070. Gen. 2:7
1071. Gen. 2:9; 1 Cor. 3:2, 6

1073. Gen. 3:15; Gal. 4:4; Luke 8:5a, 11; John 12:24:
A. Christ as the seed of the woman refers to the incarnated Christ, the complete
God becoming a perfect man through the dispensing of Himself into humanity in
order to destroy Satan and to save the believers in Christ from sin and death-

ing what He is.
D. The image of God in Colossians 1:15 refers to the expression of God and the
fullness of God, that is, Christ Himself.
E. The expression the image of the invisible God implies that although God Him-
self is invisible, His image is visible-v. 15.
F. The invisible God has a visible image, and this image is Christ:
1. John 1:18 says, “No one has ever seen God
1092. Heb. 1:6
1093. Heb. 1:6.
C. Paul was able to see the Lord’s resurrection in Psalm 2:7: “You are My Son

marvelous things for us through the grace of Christ until God’s complete salvation
is accomplished in us-Rom. 8:35; Hosea 11:4.
4. These marvelous things provoke God’s enemy to attack us with all kinds of calam-
ities, but because of our response to the love of God in Christ, these attacks have
become benefits to us

carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a
view to the satanic system of error-Eph. 4:14.
5. This perfecting will cause every member of the Body of Christ to be a building mem-
ber in love-growing up into the Head and functioning out from the Head-vv. 15-16.
II. Ephesians 6:10-20 reveals that Christ is the constituents of God’s armor:

2. In Romans 8:34 it is Christ who intercedes for us, yet in verse 26 it is the Spirit who
intercedes for us:
a. These are not two Intercessors but one, the Lord Spirit-2 Cor. 3:18.
b. He is interceding for us at two ends: at one end it is the Spirit in us, probably
initiating the intercession for us
1172. John 20:22; Lam. 3:55-56; Rom. 10:12-13
1173. John 20:22; Lam. 3:55-56; Rom. 10:12-13.
(3) In order to live in our spirit, we need to remain in the fellowship of the divine
life to walk in the divine light-1 John 1:2-3, 6-7.
2. We can mind the things of the Spirit-setting our mind on the spirit-Rom. 8:5-6:
a. We need to take heed to our spirit, paying attention to the sense of our spirit,
in order to not grieve the Spirit and not quench the Spirit-Mal. 2:15-16; Eph.
4:30; 1 Thes. 5:19.
b. We can set our mind on the spirit by setting our mind on God’s words, which are
spirit and life-John 6:63; Isa. 55:8-11.
c. To set our mind on the spirit, to mind the things of the Spirit, is also to be one
with the Lord to care for the church with all the saints in the inward parts of
Christ Jesus-Phil. 2:21
1174. John 4:10; Luke 11:13
1175. John 4:14b
1176. John 4:14b.
2. This freeing includes the enjoyment of true rest, without being under the heavy
burden to keep the law-Matt. 11:28-30.
H. The transforming Spirit dispenses the divine life, nature, essence, element-even the
Divine Being-into us so that we may be metabolically changed in our inner being-
2 Cor. 3:18:
1. When we turn our heart to the Lord to behold and reflect the glory of the Lord with
an unveiled face, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has
done.
2. Thus, we are being transformed metabolically from one degree of glory to another
degree of glory to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence.
I. The transmitting Spirit transmits all that Christ is with all the riches of God into us
for our participation-13:14:
1. God is love, and this love is being transmitted as grace into us by the Spirit, who is
the Transmitter.
2. The Spirit is the fellowship, the communication, the circulation, the transmission of
the grace of Christ with the love of the Father, transmitting the divine riches into
our being for our enjoyment.

I. “By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto
this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints”-Eph. 6:18:
1. Prayer may be considered the seventh item of the armor of God, because it is the
means by which we apply the other items.
2. Prayer is the unique way to apply Christ as the armor of God

(2) Righteousness refers to God the Son, for Christ came to accomplish
God’s purpose according to God’s righteous procedure-Rom. 5:17-18, 21.
(3) Truth, the expression of the fruit of the light, refers to God the Spirit,
for He is the Spirit of reality-John 14:17
1209. Matt. 1:18, 20;
Luke 1:35
1210. Matt. 1:18, 20;
Luke 1:35.
2. When the Lord Jesus was resurrected from among the dead, He was desig-
nated the Son of God in power by resurrection according to the Spirit of
holiness that was in Him-Rom. 1:4.
3. Now He is the Son of God in a way that is more wonderful than before, for now
He has both the divine nature and the resurrected, transformed, uplifted,
glorified, and designated human nature-6:4; Luke 24:26; John 17:5; Acts
3:13.
E. We need to connect Romans 1:3-4 and 8:29:
1. Through His incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, Christ, the Son of God,
became the firstborn Son, and the many sons, who are the brothers of Christ,
are being conformed to His image-Heb. 2:10-11; Rom. 8:29.
2. In Romans 1:3-4 Christ, the Son of God, is the prototype, whereas in 8:29 the
many brothers are those who have been “mass-produced” from the prototype
and, by being saved in life, will be conformed to the image of the firstborn
Son.
3. This brings us to the matter of deification and implies that God’s intention
in His economy is to make Himself man so that, in Christ, we, the believers in
Christ and children of God, may become God in life, in nature, and in con-
stitution (but not in the Godhead)

1213. Matt. 26:26
1214. Matt. 26:26:
a. The bread denotes life, the life of God, the eternal life
1215. Matt. 26:27-28
1216. Matt. 26:27-28:
a. The cup denotes blessing, which is God Himself as our portion-Psa. 16:5.
b. The Lord’s salvation has become our portion, the cup of salvation that runs
over, the content of which is God as our all-inclusive blessing-116:13
1217. Matt. 5:14; 1 John 1:5
1218. Matt. 5:14; 1 John 1:5.
3. When we are in the light, we are outside the realm of right and wrong-v. 7.
4. If we walk as children of light, we will bear the fruit described in Ephesians
5:9:
a. The fruit of the light must be good in nature, righteous in procedure, and
real in expression, that God may be expressed as the reality of our daily
walk.
b. The fruit of the light in goodness, righteousness, and truth is related to the
Triune God:
(1) God the Father as goodness is the nature of the fruit of the light
1219. Matt. 5:48
1220. Matt. 6:34
1221. Matt. 6:34.
3. Manna is from heaven-Exo. 16:4; John 6:41.
4. Manna comes with the dew-Exo. 16:13-14; Num. 11:9; Psa. 133:3; Lam. 3:22-23;
Heb. 4:16; Psa. 110:3.
5. Manna comes in the morning-Exo. 16:21
1222. Matt. 6:6
1223. Matt. 6:6; 14:23; Exo. 33:11a; 34:4, footnote 2.
1224. Matthew 26:29
1225. Matthew 26:29: “I shall by no means drink of this product of the vine
from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of My
Father.”
4. Thus, to declare the Lord’s death until He comes is to declare the existence of the
church for the bringing in of the kingdom

B. Since Christ has been crucified and the Spirit has been given, there is no need for
Christ to be crucified again
1235. Num. 20:8
1236. Num. 20:8:
1. To take the rod is to identify with Christ in His death and apply the death of
Christ to ourselves and our situation.
2. To speak to the rock is to speak a direct word to Christ as the smitten rock, asking
Him to give us the Spirit of life based on the fact that the Spirit has already been
given-cf. John 4:10; Luke 11:13.
3. If we apply the death of Christ to ourselves and ask Christ in faith to give us the
Spirit, we will receive the living Spirit as the bountiful supply of life.
D. Instead of speaking to the rock, Moses was angry with the people, condemned them
as rebels, and struck the rock with his rod twice-Num. 20:9-11:
1. Moses condemned the people as rebels, but Moses was the one who rebelled
against God’s word-v. 24

30:23-25; Rom. 10:12-13
1244. Phil. 1:19; Exo.
30:23-25; Rom. 10:12-13:
1. The reaching of the anointing accomplishes the central purpose of God’s salvation to
anoint the compounded God into us so that we may be united, mingled, and incorpo-
rated with Him-1 Cor. 15:45b; 1 John 2:20, 27.
2. The teaching of the anointing is the inward feeling generated by the moving of the
Spirit within us, enabling us to know God’s mind and to live in Him, teaching us the
things concerning the Triune God and His activities-v. 27; Acts 16:6-7.
B. The sealing Spirit forms the divine elements into an impression to express God’s image-
2 Cor. 1:22; Eph. 1:13:
1. The sealing Spirit saturates the believers continuously unto the redemption of their
body-4:30.
2. The sealing Spirit transforms the believers into a treasure to God as His inheri-
tance-1:11.
3. The more we are sealed, the more we bear the image of God to be constituted into
the masterpiece of God-2 Cor. 3:18b; Eph. 2:10.
C. The pledging Spirit gives us a foretaste as a sample and guarantee of the full taste of
God-2 Cor. 1:22
1245. Phil. 1:19; Rom. 5:10; 10:12-13.
1246. Phil. 1:20-21a
1247. Phil. 1:20-21a.
2. We are identified with Christ in His death in order that it may be no longer
we who live but Christ who lives in us-Rom. 6:3-4; Gal. 2:20.
3. We live such a life in Christ as our faith
1248. Phil. 1:25
1249. Phil. 1:25.
G. The freeing Spirit frees us from the bondage of the letter of the law
1250. Phil. 2:13
1251. Phil. 2:13.
2. We need to cooperate with the indwelling, installed, automatic, and inner operating
God by prayer and by having a spirit of dependence, thus maintaining our fellow-
ship with the Lord of life and the Lord of work-1 Thes. 5:17; Eph. 6:17-18.
3. We need to care for the sense of life in our spirit to remain in the fellowship of life,
the flowing of the divine life, for the operation of the law of the Spirit of life-Rom.
8:6, 16; 1 John 1:2-3, 6-7.
F. The whole key to our living and serving in the Body of Christ is the law of the Spirit of
life, which operates within us:
1. The law of the Spirit of life makes us God in life, nature, and expression but not in
the Godhead, shaping us into the image of the firstborn Son of God so that we may
become His corporate expression-Rom. 8:2, 29.
2. The law of the Spirit of life constitutes us the members of the Body of Christ with
all kinds of functions-Eph. 4:11-12, 16.
G. We can cooperate with the inner operating Triune God as the law of the Spirit of life by
“switching on” this law in the following ways:
1. We need to walk according to the spirit-live in the spirit-Rom. 8:4, cf. Psa. 23:3:
a. The secret of experiencing Christ is to be in the One who empowers us to do all
things, and the secret of being in Him is to be in our spirit-Phil. 4:12-13, 23.
b. The practicality of living in Christ is for us to live in our spirit
1252. Phil. 2:13;
Ezek. 36:26-27; Prov. 30:18-19; Isa. 40:28-31; Heb. 12:2a; Phil. 4:13; Col. 1:28-29
1253. Phil. 2:13;
Ezek. 36:26-27; Prov. 30:18-19; Isa. 40:28-31; Heb. 12:2a; Phil. 4:13; Col. 1:28-29.
E. While we remain in the touch with the Lord, staying in contact with the Lord, the law
of the Spirit of life works automatically, spontaneously, and effortlessly:
1. We need to cease from our own struggling and striving-Gal. 2:20a; Rom. 7:15-20:
a. If we have not seen that sin is a law and that our will can never overcome this
law, we are trapped in Romans 7
1254. Phil. 2:21
1255. Phil. 2:5; 1 Cor. 2:16
1256. Phil. 2:5; 1 Cor. 2:16.
2. Everything other than Christ must diminish, and Christ must become every-
thing to us in our experience
1257. Phil. 2:5; Eph. 3:17a
1258. Phil. 2:5; Eph. 3:17a.
3. To have Christ possess our entire being is to have Him formed in us-Gal.
4:19.
C. For Christ to make His home in our hearts, He needs to be able to settle down
within us, and this requires that we allow Christ to make His home in all the
parts of our inner being
1259. Phil. 2:6
1260. Phil. 2:6)
1261. Phil. 3:21
1262. Phil. 3:21.
5. It is of God that we participate in such a complete and perfect salvation, which makes
our entire being-spirit, soul, and body-organically one with Christ to make Him
everything to us and to make us the wise exhibition of all that Christ is.
III. On the cross Christ created the new man in Himself by abolishing in His flesh
the law of the commandments in ordinances, the middle wall of partition-Eph.
2:14b-15a:
A. The law spoken of in verse 15 is not the law of the moral commandments but the law of
the ritual commandments, such as the ordinances of circumcision, keeping the Sabbath,
and eating certain foods.
B. Ordinances are the forms or ways of living and worship, which create enmity and divi-
sion:
1. On the cross Christ abolished all the regulations regarding living and worship,
regulations that have divided the nations-v. 15; Col. 2:14.
2. From the time of Babel, mankind has been divided by ordinances concerning the ways
of living and worship
1263. Phil. 3:8-14
1264. Phil. 3:8-14.
C. God freely gives us all things with Christ
1265. Phil. 4:12-13, 23
1266. Phil. 4:13
1267. Phil. 4:13.
3. Christ as the power of God is daily supplying and sustaining us through His
divine dispensing.
F. Christ as the wisdom of God flows unceasingly from God to us to be our present
and practical wisdom in our experience-1 Cor. 1:24.
III. “Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both
righteousness and sanctification and redemption”-v. 30:
A. In this verse Paul does not say that Christ became our wisdom

b. “Jehovah make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you” is the grace of
Christ as the fatness of God’s house-Num. 6:25; Psa. 36:8.
c. “Jehovah lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace” is the fellowship
of the Holy Spirit as the river of God’s pleasures-Num. 6:26; Psa. 36:8.
B. The grace of God in His economy is rich, multiplying, and abounding-Eph. 2:7; 1 Pet.
1:2b; 2 Pet. 1:2; Eph. 1:7b-8:
1. God has graced us in the Beloved-v. 6.
2. We have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand-Rom. 5:2a.
3. When Christ in us is daily received, experienced, and enjoyed by us, that is grace
being added to us, grace upon grace-John 1:16.
C. The new covenant ministers’ living is the living of grace, the experience of grace-Heb.
12:28; 1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 1:12, 15:
1. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Spirit of grace, is with our spirit, which has
been regenerated to be the dwelling place and vessel of the Triune God-Heb. 10:29b;
Gal. 6:18; Phil. 4:23
1277. Psa. 45:1
1278. Psa. 45:1:
1. Christ is being inscribed into us with the spiritual ink, the Spirit of the living God
1279. Psa. 68:18
1280. Psa. 68:18.
(3) In His ascension Christ led them to the heavens as His captives in His train
of vanquished foes and made them gifts to His Body.
(4) Now Christ is celebrating His triumph over them, His vanquished foes, and
is leading them as His captives in a triumphal procession in His move for
His ministry to build up His Body-2 Cor. 2:14.
2. The more Christ ascends and descends within us, capturing and vanquishing us, the
more He fills us with Himself to constitute us as gifts to His Body-cf. Eph. 4:9-10.
C. The intrinsic building up of the organic Body of Christ is by the gifted persons’ perfect-
ing of the saints in the divine dispensing so that all the saints may be able to do the
work of the New Testament ministry, that is, to build up the Body of Christ-vv. 11-12:
1. The gifted persons perfect the saints by nourishing them according to the tree of life
with the life supply for their growth in life-Gen. 2:9; 1 Cor. 3:2, 6.
2. The gifted persons perfect the saints to do what they do for the direct building of the
Body of Christ-Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:11-12

10:7 says, “The mystery of God is finished”:
A. “To seal up vision and prophet” (Dan. 9:24c) is to close the age of mystery, that
is, to finish the mystery of God (Rev. 10:7; 1 Tim. 3:9).
B. In the dispensations from Adam to Moses and from Moses to Christ, everything
was unveiled, manifested, and there was no mystery.
C. It will be the same in the dispensation of the millennial kingdom and the new
heaven and new earth-everything will be unveiled, and then there will be no
more mystery.
D. Christ Himself (Col. 2:2), the church (Eph. 3:4-6), the kingdom of the heavens
(Matt. 13:11), the gospel (Eph. 6:19), the indwelling of Christ (Col. 1:26-27), and
the coming resurrection and transfiguration of the saints as the end of this
dispensation of mystery (1 Cor. 15:51-52) are all mysteries that were hidden in
times of the ages (Rom. 16:25; Eph. 3:5; Col. 1:26).
E. All these mysteries will be completed, finished, and will be over at the trum-
peting of the seventh trumpet.
F. At the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet, not only God’s judgment of wrath
upon the earth but also the mystery of God are finished.
G. In the dispensation from the incarnation of Christ to the millennial kingdom-
the church age, the age of grace-everything is a mystery:
1. The incarnation of Christ, as the beginning of the age of mystery, is a mys-
tery-1 Tim. 3:16.
2. Christ is the mystery of God-Col. 2:2.
3. The church is the mystery of Christ-Eph. 3:4-6:
a. Christ is a mystery, and the church, as the Body of Christ to express
Him, is the mystery of Christ.
b. Christ and the church as one spirit are the great mystery-5:32; 1 Cor.
6:17.
c. During the church age, the age of mystery, Christ is building up the
church to be His bride-Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:16; Rev. 19:7-9.
4. The kingdom of the heavens, the indwelling of Christ, and the resurrection
and transfiguration of the saints are all mysteries-Matt. 13:11; Col. 1:26-27;
1 Cor. 15:51-53.
IV. The mystery of the church is the ultimate mystery in the universe:
A. The church is the hidden mystery in God’s eternal economy-Eph. 3:9-11:
1. The mystery of the universe is God, the mystery of God is Christ, and the
mystery of Christ is the church-Gen. 1:1; Rev. 4:11; Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4.
2. According to Ephesians 3:4, the church has a particular title-the mystery
of Christ.
3. In the ages before the New Testament, the mystery of the church was hidden
from men

8:6, 16; 1 John 1:2-3, 6-7
1300. Rom. 10:14
1301. Rom. 10:14.

1302. Rom. 10:17
1303. Rom. 12:2
1304. Rom. 12:2.
II. In 2 Corinthians 4:4 Paul speaks of “the illumination of the gospel of the
glory of Christ, who is the image of God”:
A. In this verse Paul also informs us that the god of this age, the ruler of this world
(John 12:31
1305. Rom. 12:2a
1306. Rom. 12:3
1307. Rom. 12:3.
B. The intrinsic building up of the organic Body of Christ is by the giving of the gifted
persons, such as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, who are
constituted by the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, by Christ as the Head in His ascen-
sion (including His resurrection), to the Body of Christ-Eph. 4:8-12:
1. Ephesians 4:8 says, “Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken cap-
tive and gave gifts to men”:
a. Height in the quotation from Psalm 68:18 refers to Mount Zion (vv. 15-16), sym-
bolizing the third heaven, where God dwells (1 Kings 8:30).
b. Psalm 68 implies that it was in the Ark that God ascended to Mount Zion after
the Ark had won the victory (Num. 10:35)
1308. Rom. 13:12-14; Deut. 32:30
1309. Rom. 13:12-14; Deut. 32:30.

Eph. 3:3, 5
1314. Rom. 16:25;
Eph. 3:3, 5:
A. The mystery of Christ, the church, was hidden in other generations but has
been revealed in the New Testament age-v. 5.
B. This mystery was hidden in God throughout the ages, but now the New Testa-
ment believers, having been enlightened, are able to see it-v. 9.
C. The mystery of Christ has been revealed to the apostles and prophets in their
spirit by revelation-v. 5:
1. The mingled spirit is the means by which the New Testament revelation con-
cerning Christ and the church is unveiled to the apostles and prophets.
2. When our spirit is mingled with the divine Spirit, our spirit becomes the
organ to which the mystery of Christ is revealed-1 Cor. 6:17; Eph. 1:17
1315. Rom. 16:25; Eph. 3:5; Col. 1:26

1320. Rom. 1:3-4; Acts 13:33; Heb. 1:5.
4. This designation of the Son of God was “in power,” the power of Christ’s resur-
rection, the reality of which is the Spirit-Rom. 1:4; Phil. 3:10; Eph. 1:19-20.
C. Through designation in resurrection the Christ who was already the Son of God
before His incarnation became the Son of God in a new way-Rom. 1:4:
1. Before His incarnation He was the Son of God only with divinity
1321. Rom. 1:4
1322. Rom. 1:4.
b. Even Christ’s human nature has been designated the Son of God, for He
has been designated the Son of God with both divinity and humanity.
D. The designation of Christ as the Son of God with humanity was “according to
the Spirit of holiness”-v. 4:
1. The Spirit of holiness is the life essence within the Lord Jesus
1323. Rom. 1:4; Phil. 3:10; Eph. 1:19-20
1324. Rom. 5:10
1325. Rom. 5:10:
1. To declare the Lord’s death is to proclaim and display the Lord’s death
1326. Rom. 5:17
1327. Rom. 5:17-18, 21
1328. Rom. 5:17.
10. We need to be good stewards of the varied grace of God-1 Pet. 4:10; Eph. 3:2.
11. Our word should convey grace to the hearers-Luke 4:22; Eph. 4:29; Isa. 50:4.
12. We need to enjoy the grace of life in the church life to keep ourselves in the genuine
oneness-Psa. 133.
13. In the church life, when we have grace upon us, the church will be built up, and the
grace that we receive will be visible-Acts 4:33
1329. Rom. 5:18
1330. Rom. 5:18.
2. He is our sanctification (for our present), by which we are being sanctified in
our soul, that is, transformed in our mind, emotion, and will, with His divine
life-6:19, 22.
3. He is our redemption (for our future), that is, the redemption of our body (8:23),
by which we will be transfigured in our body with His divine life to have His
glorious likeness (Phil. 3:21).
4. It is of God that we participate in such a complete and perfect salvation, which
makes our entire being-spirit, soul, and body-organically one with Christ
and makes Christ everything to us.
5. This is altogether of God, not of ourselves, that we may boast and glory in
Him, not in ourselves-Eph. 3:20-21.

Share five major points concerning why Romans 8 is of the utmost importance:
1. ROMANS 8 MAY BE CONSIDERED THE FOCUS OF THE ENTIRE BIBLE AND THE
CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE. In eternity past God purposed to enter into His redeemed people so
that He could be their life and so that they could be His corporate expression
1364. Rom. 8:35.
F. In all the sufferings we more than conquer through Christ who loved us-v. 37:
1. Because of God’s unchanging love for us and the fact that Christ has accomplished
everything on our behalf, neither tribulation nor persecution can suppress or defeat
us
1365. Rom. 8:35; Hosea 11:4
1366. Rom. 8:3:
1. After the Son of God became incarnate, His divine nature was concealed by
the flesh.
2. Christ was already the Son of God in His divinity, but the part of Him that
was Jesus with the human nature, born of Mary, was not the Son of God-
Luke 1:31-32, 35.
3. By His resurrection Christ sanctified and uplifted His human nature, His
humanity, and He was designated out of resurrection as the Son of God with
this human nature

thoughts shot in by the evil one
