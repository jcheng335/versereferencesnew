Christ, having died for us and having been raised, is interceding for us at the right hand\nof God\u2014Rom. 8:34:\n1. In verse 34 Christ is at the right hand of God, yet in verse 10 Christ is now in us, in\nour spirit\u20142 Tim. 4:22; cf. John 1:51; Gen. 28:11-22.\n2. In Romans 8:34 it is Christ who intercedes for us, yet in verse 26 it is the Spirit who\nintercedes for us:\na. These are not two Intercessors but one, the Lord Spirit\u20142 Cor. 3:18.\nb. He is interceding for us at two ends: at one end it is the Spirit in us, probably\ninitiating the intercession for us; at the other end it is the Lord Christ at the right\nhand of God, probably completing the intercession for us, which must be mainly\nthat we will be conformed to His image and brought into His glory.\nE. No suffering, including tribulation, anguish, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, and\nsword, shall separate us from the love of Christ\u2014Rom. 8:35.\nF. In all the sufferings we more than conquer through Christ who loved us\u2014v. 37:\n1. Because of God\u2019s unchanging love for us and the fact that Christ has accomplished\neverything on our behalf, neither tribulation nor persecution can suppress or defeat\nus; rather, in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us.\n2. The love of God is the source of His eternal salvation; this love, from which nothing\ncan separate us, is in Christ and has been poured out in our hearts through the\nHoly Spirit\u2014vv. 38-39; 5:5; Jer. 31:3.\n3. In God\u2019s salvation the love of God has become the love of Christ, which does many\nmarvelous things for us through the grace of Christ until God\u2019s complete salvation\nis accomplished in us\u2014Rom. 8:35; Hosea 11:4.\n4. These marvelous things provoke God\u2019s enemy to attack us with all kinds of calam-\nities, but because of our response to the love of God in Christ, these attacks have\nbecome benefits to us; hence, we more than conquer in all our afflictions and calami-\nties\u2014Rom. 8:35-37, 28.\n\u00a9 2024 Living Stream Ministry\n        1 Cor. 2:9-10: 9. But as it is written, \u201cThings which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not come up in man\u2019s heart; things which God has prepared for those who love Him.\u201d 10. But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit , for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.\n        2 Tim. 3:2-4: 2. For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boasters , arrogant , revilers , disobedient to parents, unthankful , unholy , 3. Without natural affection, implacable , slanderers , without self-control, savage, not lovers of good, 4. Traitors , reckless , blinded with pride, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,\n        2 Cor. 5:14: 14. For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died;\n        Rom. 8:31: 31. What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?\n         Jer. 31:31-34: 31. Indeed, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, 32. Not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by their hand to bring them out from the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, although I was their Husband , declares Jehovah. 33. But this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares Jehovah: I will put My law in their inward parts and write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God , and they will be My people. 34. And they will no longer teach, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for all of them will know Me, from the little one among them even to the great one among them, declares Jehovah, for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more .\n         Heb. 8:8-10: 8. For finding fault with them He says, \u201cBehold, the days are coming, says the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant upon the house of Israel and upon the house of Judah, 9. Not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the Lord. 10. For this is the covenant which I will covenant with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will impart My laws into their mind , and on their hearts I will inscribe them; and I will be God to them, and they will be a people to Me.\n        Jer. 32:40-41: 40. And I will make an eternal covenant with them that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; and I will put My fear into their hearts, so that they will not turn away from Me. 41. And I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness with all My heart and with all My soul.\n         Phil. 3:8-14: 8. But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ 9. And be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is out of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is out of God and based on faith, 10. To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, 11. If perhaps I may attain to the out- resurrection from the dead. 12. Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected , but I pursue , if even I may lay hold of that for which I also have been laid hold of by Christ Jesus. 13. Brothers, I do not account of myself to have laid hold; but one thing I do: Forgetting the things which are behind and stretching forward to the things which are before, 14. I pursue toward the goal for the prize to which God in Christ Jesus has called me upward.\n        Rom. 8:28: 28. And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose .\n        1 Cor. 3:21-22: 21. So then let no one boast in men, for all things are yours, 22. Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all are yours,\n        Rom. 8:34: 34. Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died and, rather, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.\n        2 Tim. 4:22: 22. The Lord be with your spirit . Grace be with you.\n         John 1:51: 51. And He said to him, Truly , truly, I say to you, You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.\n         Gen. 28:11-22: 11. And he came to a certain place and spent the night there, because the sun had set. And he took one of the stones of the place and put it under his head, and he lay down in that place. 12. And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. 13. And there was Jehovah, standing above it; and He said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie, I will give to you and to your seed . 14. And your seed will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed. 15. And, behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go and will cause you to return to this land, for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you. 16. And Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, Surely Jehovah is in this place, and I did not know it. 17. And he was afraid and said, How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. 18. And Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put under his head, and he set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it. 19. And he called the name of that place Bethel , but the name of the city was Luz previously. 20. And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and garments to put on, 21. So that I return to my father\u2019s house in peace, then Jehovah will be my God, 22. And this stone , which I have set up as a pillar, will be God\u2019s house; and of all that You give me I will surely give one tenth to You.\n         In Romans 8:34: [Verse not found]\n        2 Cor. 3:18: 18. But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory , even as from the Lord Spirit.\n        Rom. 8:35: 35. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?\n         Jer. 31:3: 3. Jehovah appeared to me from afar, saying, Indeed I have loved you with an eternal love, Therefore I have drawn you with lovingkindness.\n         Hosea 11:4: 4. I drew them with cords of a man, With bands of love; And I was to them like those Who lift off the yoke on their jaws; And I gently caused them to eat .\n        Rom. 8:35-37: 35. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword? 36. As it is written, \u201cFor Your sake we are being put to death all day long; we have been accounted as sheep for slaughter.\u201d 37. But in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us.\n\n        1. By loving God, we participate in all the riches contained in God\u20141 Cor. 2:9-10; cf. 2 Tim. 3:2-4.\n            1 Cor. 2:9-10: 9. But as it is written, \u201cThings which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not come up in man\u2019s heart; things which God has prepared for those who love Him.\u201d 10. But to us God has revealed them through the Spirit , for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.\n            2 Tim. 3:2-4: 2.

Without natural affection, implacable , slanderers , without self-control, savage, not lovers of good, 4. Traitors , reckless , blinded with pride, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,\n\n        2. We need to be constrained by the love of Christ to love God and the saints with Christ as our love\u20142 Cor. 5:14.\n            2 Cor. 5:14: 14. For the love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died;\n\n    B. \u201cIf God is for us, who can be against us?\u201d\u2014Rom. 8:31; Jer. 31:31-34; Heb. 8:8-10:\n        Rom. 8:31: 31. What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?\n         Jer. 31:31-34: 31. Indeed, days are coming, declares Jehovah, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, 32. Not like the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by their hand to bring them out from the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, although I was their Husband , declares Jehovah. 33.

And I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness with all My heart and with all My soul\u201d\u2014Jer. 32:40-41.\n            Jer. 32:40-41: 40. And I will make an eternal covenant with them that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; and I will put My fear into their hearts, so that they will not turn away from Me. 41. And I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness with all My heart and with all My soul.\n\n        2. This eternal covenant is the new covenant; it is by this covenant that God will not turn away from us and will plant us in Christ, our good land, and Christ in all His aspects will be bought by us, that is, gained by us through our paying the price to forget the things that are behind and pursue Christ\u2014vv. 40-44; Phil. 3:8-14.\n             Phil. 3:8-14: 8. But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ 9.

And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose .\n        1 Cor. 3:21-22: 21.

Christ, having died for us and having been raised, is interceding for us at the right hand of God\u2014Rom. 8:34:\n        Rom. 8:34: 34. Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died and, rather, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us.\n\n        1. In verse 34 Christ is at the right hand of God, yet in verse 10 Christ is now in us, in our spirit\u20142 Tim. 4:22; cf. John 1:51; Gen. 28:11-22.\n            2 Tim. 4:22: 22.

In Romans 8:34 it is Christ who intercedes for us, yet in verse 26 it is the Spirit who intercedes for us: initiating the intercession for us; at the other end it is the Lord Christ at the right hand of God, probably completing the intercession for us, which must be mainly that we will be conformed to His image and brought into His glory.\n            In Romans 8:34: [Verse not found]\n\n            a.

No suffering, including tribulation, anguish, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, and sword, shall separate us from the love of Christ\u2014Rom. 8:35.\n        Rom. 8:35: 35. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?\n\n    F. In all the sufferings we more than conquer through Christ who loved us\u2014v. 37:\n        1. Because of God\u2019s unchanging love for us and the fact that Christ has accomplished everything on our behalf, neither tribulation nor persecution can suppress or defeat us; rather, in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us.\n        2. The love of God is the source of His eternal salvation; this love, from which nothing can separate us, is in Christ and has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit\u2014vv. 38-39; 5:5; Jer. 31:3.\n             Jer. 31:3: 3. Jehovah appeared to me from afar, saying, Indeed I have loved you with an eternal love, Therefore I have drawn you with lovingkindness.\n\n        3. In God\u2019s salvation the love of God has become the love of Christ, which does many marvelous things for us through the grace of Christ until God\u2019s complete salvation is accomplished in us\u2014Rom. 8:35; Hosea 11:4.\n            Rom. 8:35: 35. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?\n             Hosea 11:4: 4. I drew them with cords of a man, With bands of love; And I was to them like those Who lift off the yoke on their jaws; And I gently caused them to eat .\n\n        4. These marvelous things provoke God\u2019s enemy to attack us with all kinds of calam- ities, but because of our response to the love of God in Christ, these attacks have become benefits to us; hence, we more than conquer in all our afflictions and calami- ties\u2014Rom. 8:35-37, 28. \u00a9 2024 Living Stream Ministry Share five major points concerning why Romans 8 is of the utmost importance:\n1. ROMANS 8 MAY BE CONSIDERED THE FOCUS OF THE ENTIRE BIBLE AND THE\nCENTER OF THE UNIVERSE. In eternity past God purposed to enter into His redeemed people so\nthat He could be their life and so that they could be His corporate expression; this is the focus of God\u2019s\neconomy (1 Tim. 1:3-5). Man is the center of God\u2019s creation, because God\u2019s intention is to be expressed\nthrough man; man can become God\u2019s expression only by God entering into man to be man\u2019s life and\ncontent and to make man one with Him so that man may live by Him and even live Him out; in this\nway God is expressed from within man. Zechariah 12:1 reveals that the heavens are for the earth, the\nearth is for man, and man was created by God with a spirit so that he may contact God, receive God,\nworship God, live God, fulfill God\u2019s purpose for God, and be one with God. The central focus in the\nuniverse is that the processed Triune God as the law of the Spirit of life has come into us and now\ndwells in us; this is the greatest miracle; nothing else in the universe could be more important than\nthis (Isa. 66:1-2; John 14:23; 15:4). We should all be full of joy since the Triune God is indwelling us\nand is one with us; He is our life and our person, and He is making us His home (Eph. 3:14-17).\n2. A CHAPTER FOR DESPERATE SEEKERS\u2014Romans 7:24-25a; Romans 8:2.\n3. THE KEY TO BEING A CHRISTIAN\u2014living in the realm of impossibility (the realm of\nresurrection)\u2014Romans 8:2-4\u2014\u201cFor the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the\nlaw of sin and of death. For that which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh,\nGod, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in\nthe flesh, that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk\naccording to the flesh but according to the spirit.\u201d This shows that the law of the Spirit of life even\nincludes an element that deals with impossibility\u2014vv. 10, 6, 11; cf. Rev. 21:23; 22:1-2, 14.\n4. THE KEY TO BEING AN OVERCOMER\u2014Isaiah 40:31\u2014\u201cYet those who wait on Jehovah will\nrenew their strength; they will mount up with wings like eagles; they will run and will not become\nweary; they will walk and will not faint.\u201d (See notes 1 and 2).\n5. THE SECRET OF HOW TO HAVE THE BODY LIFE AND OF LIVING IN THE BODY OF\nCHRIST IS IN ROMANS 8. (Romans 9-11 is a parenthesis, and Romans 12 is a direct continuation\nof Romans 8.) When we \u201cswitch on\u201d the law of the Spirit of life, right away we will be in the Body of\nChrist in an actual way. The reality of the Body of Christ is the corporate living by the perfected\nGod-men who are matured by continually exercising to reject the self and live by another life, the\ndivine life, which is the law of the Spirit of life. This kind of living, which is the reality of the Body\nof Christ, will close this age, the age of the church, and will bring Christ back to take, possess, and\nrule over this earth with these God-men in the kingdom age.\n\u00a9 2024 Living Stream Ministry Share five major points concerning why Romans 8 is of the utmost importance:\n            Rom. 8:35-37: 35. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword? 36. As it is written, \u201cFor Your sake we are being put to death all day long; we have been accounted as sheep for slaughter.\u201d 37. But in all these things we more than conquer through Him who loved us.\n            1 Tim. 1:3-5: 3. Even as I exhorted you, when I was going into Macedonia , to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things 4. Nor to give heed to myths and unending genealogies , which produce questionings rather than God\u2019s economy , which is in faith . 5. But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience and out of unfeigned faith ;\n             Zechariah 12:1: 1. The burden of the word of Jehovah concerning Israel. Thus declares Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him,\n            Isa. 66:1-2: 1. Thus says Jehovah, Heaven is My throne, And the earth the footstool for My feet. Where then is the house that you will build for Me, And where is the place of My rest? 2. For all these things My hand has made, And so all these things have come into being, declares Jehovah. But to this kind of man will I look, to him who is poor And of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at My word.\n             John 14:23: 23. Jesus answered and said to him, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.\n            Eph. 3:14-17: 14. For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father , 15. Of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named , 16.

ROMANS 8 MAY BE CONSIDERED THE FOCUS OF THE ENTIRE BIBLE AND THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE. In eternity past God purposed to enter into His redeemed people so that He could be their life and so that they could be His corporate expression; this is the focus of God\u2019s economy (1 Tim. 1:3-5). Man is the center of God\u2019s creation, because God\u2019s intention is to be expressed through man; man can become God\u2019s expression only by God entering into man to be man\u2019s life and content and to make man one with Him so that man may live by Him and even live Him out; in this way God is expressed from within man. Zechariah 12:1 reveals that the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man was created by God with a spirit so that he may contact God, receive God, worship God, live God, fulfill God\u2019s purpose for God, and be one with God. The central focus in the universe is that the processed Triune God as the law of the Spirit of life has come into us and now dwells in us; this is the greatest miracle; nothing else in the universe could be more important than this (Isa. 66:1-2; John 14:23; 15:4). We should all be full of joy since the Triune God is indwelling us and is one with us; He is our life and our person, and He is making us His home (Eph. 3:14-17).\n            1 Tim. 1:3-5: 3. Even as I exhorted you, when I was going into Macedonia , to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things 4. Nor to give heed to myths and unending genealogies , which produce questionings rather than God\u2019s economy , which is in faith . 5. But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience and out of unfeigned faith ;\n             Zechariah 12:1: 1. The burden of the word of Jehovah concerning Israel. Thus declares Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him,\n            Isa. 66:1-2: 1. Thus says Jehovah, Heaven is My throne, And the earth the footstool for My feet. Where then is the house that you will build for Me, And where is the place of My rest? 2. For all these things My hand has made, And so all these things have come into being, declares Jehovah. But to this kind of man will I look, to him who is poor And of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at My word.\n             John 14:23: 23. Jesus answered and said to him, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.\n            Eph. 3:14-17: 14. For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father , 15. Of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named , 16. That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, 17. That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith ,\n\n        2. A CHAPTER FOR DESPERATE SEEKERS\u2014Romans 7:24-25a; Romans 8:2.\n            Romans 7:24-25: 24. Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death? 25. Thanks be to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh, the law of sin.\n             Romans 8:2: 2. For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.\n\n        3.

For that which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit.\u201d This shows that the law of the Spirit of life even includes an element that deals with impossibility\u2014vv. 10, 6, 11; cf. Rev. 21:23; 22:1-2, 14.\n            Romans 8:2-4: 2. For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death. 3.

THE SECRET OF HOW TO HAVE THE BODY LIFE AND OF LIVING IN THE BODY OF CHRIST IS IN ROMANS 8. (Romans 9-11 is a parenthesis, and Romans 12 is a direct continuation of Romans 8.) When we \u201cswitch on\u201d the law of the Spirit of life, right away we will be in the Body of Christ in an actual way. The reality of the Body of Christ is the corporate living by the perfected God-men who are matured by continually exercising to reject the self and live by another life, the divine life, which is the law of the Spirit of life. This kind of living, which is the reality of the Body of Christ, will close this age, the age of the church, and will bring Christ back to take, possess, and rule over this earth with these God-men in the kingdom age. \u00a9 2024 Living Stream Ministry EXPERIENCING, ENJOYING, AND EXPRESSING CHRIST\nI.
